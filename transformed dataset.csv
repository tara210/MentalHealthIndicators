I don't feel original anymore.,"When I was in high school a few years back, I was one of the highest competitors in my school. I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that I'm trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself there's no honor in it anymore, it's just another job. I don't exercise by myself anymore. I feel like I'm not progressing anywhere in life being in service. I'm just a body and if I wasn't here doing what I'm doing, there'd just be somebody else doing the exact same. I'm replaceable. That's the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and that's the only thing I've been looking forward to since I've been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. There's nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it. I feel like I've tried everything to be happy here but it seems impossible. I wish somebody could help.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t have anyone to talk to and I don’t know what to do anymore,"Nine years ago I was diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, Six years later I was also diagnosed with PTSD due to sexual assault trauma, and finally stopped living in denial and got a formal diagnosis plus started treatment for anorexia nervosa. my life’s kinda been a train wreck for the most part. I always remember being deeply sad with an overly critical and hateful view of the world around me (human kind are doing nothing productive for the earth and it would be best if we walked hand in hand to extinction to save the planet kind of hateful) or for some periods of time feeling like I’m buzzing with happiness, in which times I felt unstoppable. With my first diagnosis, my first set of meds followed, I trialled quite a few over the years but when I decided they didn’t work for me I tried self medicating with anything I could get my hands on and ended up with major substance abuse issues. I’ve now just managed to get myself sober and maintain it for the last month.
I feel as if I’m being sucked into a giant pit of despair I can’t get myself out of and It’s progressively getting harder to leave bed. 
I get panic attacks before and during leaving the house because I’m terrified someone’s going to hurt me. I only go out to get groceries and even then sometimes I get there, panic and can’t leave the car so I just go home. 
I can’t sleep properly anymore due to horrible nightmares. I can never shake the feeling that I’m a giant burden to everyone in my life so I can’t talk to them about when I’m struggling. I’ve isolated myself so much over the past few years I don’t have a single friend left. 
I’d like to try medication again but I’m too terrified to try anything and have panic attacks thinking about taking something to shut up my mind in fear of getting addicted and out of control. Has anyone else struggled with this? What helped you overcome it?

Stuck between moving forward and killing myself,"Some background information: My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago and ever since I have been severely depressed. It wasn't a bad break-up, just a sad one. Shortly after the break-up, I noticed I wasn't dealing with it well at all. I couldn't do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldn't do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasn't angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her I'm okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.

At this point I have accepted she won't talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so. However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In March/April she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person. All I need is to talk with her and some understanding. Though I know I have messed things up so bad. I have put so much stress on her. I have done everything wrong while I knew better, but still I did it.

So far I have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)(so a double depression), and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder (e.g. avoidant, dependent, anti-social, existential OCD). I am still at the early stages so I won't have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the break-up. Still, my ex thinks she and the break-up are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she won't speak to me nor believe me.

**Now here is my dilemma: I feel the pressure to move forward with my life. I feel like I have to take on all these life responsibilities again; that I have to live my life to the fullest. I always felt like that, but because I keep overthinking everything I become this passive person who does only the minimum. I feel incredibly weak, pathetic, and scared to do almost anything, like a little kid in grown man's body. Even though I know I can do some things well, I just do not have any solid confidence. If I do nothing then my life won't get better and I will for sure never get back with my ex. Though I don't see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesn't make me happy. I don't even have the energy or motivation for it. Every time I hear someone say: ""Move on!"", ""Man up!"", ""Do \[this\] or do \[that\], I already feel the pressure and it cripples me. It's not even that I don't want to do it. I really want to live a good and healthy life, but it's like I am incapable of doing so. Seeing other people getting further in life also paralyzes me as well as watching vids on how to improve myself. Everything just scares me and paralyzes me. Still, I know it's the only way out of this and my only chance of ever getting her back. However, there is no guarantee I'll get her back. So that thought is depressing on its own. And don't get me wrong. I know there are other girls out there. That is not the problem. I am not ugly and I can date girls, and I have done so for months already. I have had bad dates and great dates, and I have met great girls I could picture a relationship with, but it simply doesn't do it for me. I want my ex. Even when I put all the emotions aside and try to rationalize it, then I still want her. Right now I just feel trapped. Moving forward won't make me happy. It is not enough. Though sitting still and doing nothing won't make me happy either. At this point, suicide seems like the only solution, but even that is a scary and hard thing to do. However, I feel it's the right thing to do as I feel far too broken and useless to continue this unsatisfying life. I wish there was some magical solution. I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt. I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous. I know that I have to do it all by myself; that it is my responsibility... but I cannot do it anymore. I am hopeless, desperate, and dysfunctional... What can I still possibly do?!**

Call me anything you want, swear at me, tell me I am a pussy, call me cringy, give me those hard truths again. Do it if you want.

Thanks for reading.

Tl;dr: GF of 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago. I want her back, but I made every mistake there is. I plunged into depression and I got diagnosed with several mental illnesses. I feel the pressure to move forward, but it's crippling me. I am too weak and scared to go on, especially when I won't get my ex back. I feel absolutely worthless and pathetic. Right now the only solution seems to be suicide because even if I go on I won't be satisfied and happy...

I need help on how to help my girlfriend.,"My girlfriend ,of about 3 months now ,has been my best friend for about 8 months and we have always talked about depression because she saw me as one of the only people she could go to to talk about this kind of stuff. Just recently though she has been cutting a lot more and it’s out of my control. I used to be able to talk her out of it, but now I can’t. She has a lot of stuff going on with her home life and school. I guess what I need help on understanding is what I can do besides just being there for her. Is there anything I can do? What can I say to help her?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
I've been feeling this way for some tine,"I'm alway feeling like this. It doesn't even matter the age we are anymore. When we are feeling low it's just that. I've been dealing with depression/anxiety since I was 12/13. It comes with just a long story that I was never able to overcome it. I tried to seek help and when she tried to suggest medication since I was already angry I just never went back. 
I just got to a point where I just say I'm ok when asked HOW ARE YOU? It's just easier to say I'm ok,  than explaining how I feel. 

night time is the worst for me since I'm alone in my room. I've tried to text people that I was once able to do, but that turned out wrong for me so I guess I don't have that option anymore. 

I've done things in the past where I am trying to avoid but as selfish as that may sound to others I found my comfort in that.  I don't want to do that anymore.  Finally admitted to myself that I cannot do this anymore by myself. 
This whole year has been a night mare for me but I still tried and I feel like kept falling deeper and deeper. Like being in a coma but with my eyes open. Like being in a crowded room and yet I'm still feeling alone, boxed in, no way out. I've become so afraid of being alone, that I am alone.
 Lost valuable friends, a great partner and I cannot get any of it back. 
I held back on telling people how I feel with the fear of losing anyone else. But that hold inside me makes it worse and I know that, but I don't want to lose anyone else. I don't know if I would, but that thought is just there. I feel as if I sleep walk awake. Sorry it just been to  much. My heart beats fast, with just even writing this my head hurts from it all. 
I want to tell people how I feel the ones matter, but its that fear that hold me back. Don't know why or where this all came from but it's been even harder to get myself together. Maybe I deserve to be alone. I deserve to not have you as my friend. I just feel lost and empty.

I have no motivation,"This is hard.  I am not doing very well.  My life has been falling apart for a while now, I don't know how I'm even functioning right now.  I don't even have the energy to switch to my anonymous account for this anymore.

It started after I lost my job.  Then I lost my wife.  I'm working a menial overnight job now, and I just can't bring myself to start today.  I feel like I lost myself.  I feel like I'm unworthy of love or compassion or kindness.  I feel miserable every second.  I tell myself that I am okay, because u know I'm not and if I keep telling myself I'm okay then maybe I will believe it.  I miss my wife.  I miss her for all the obvious reasons you miss a spouse.  I try and put myself out there because I think I'm ready, but I'm not over her and I don't know when I will be over her.  She was my first.  I miss her.  

I went to therapy for a little while.  She gave me some advice that didn't work and I stopped going.  It never helped anyway, I would leave feeling 100 times worse.

We have a kid, she is 3.  The nature of the new job allows me to watch her while my wife goes to work.  I try and sleep a little and I wake up to make sure she is ok then I go back to sleep.  I couldn't sleep today.  I couldn't do much of anything.  I did all the things I'm supposed to do as her father, but that was it.  Normally I play and interact with her, but I just laid there without sleeping staring at nothing.  I feel like such a failure.  Everything is falling apart and I have no one to talk to and nothing I can do.  

I tried winning her back several times.  I bore my soul.  She doesn't want me or doesn't love me or both, and it tears me up inside.  All I ever did was love her.  I was just going through a real bad fit of depression, for longer than I think I was.  I just feel so lost.  I'd do anything to get my family back, but I promised her I wouldnt try anymore so now I just have to sit back and watch as she drifts further and further away from me. 

I don't know why I'm posting this.  I hate it when people fuss over me, so I don't know what's making me do this.  I just want to stop feeling so miserable.

This is me finally talking about “it”.,"I do not have depression, my husband does. He has depression, but we don’t use that word. We say “dark days” and on those days his mood is self-described as “blah”. He has depression, but we don’t talk about it.       
It’s not for lack of trying on my part. I wish he could open up and tell me how he’s feeling. I wish he could cry with me and tell me that we’ll get through this as much as I tell him. My husband has depression, but we don’t tell anyone about it. “Where’s your husband?” Is the hardest question to hear sometimes. “Why didn’t your husband come?” “He isn’t feeling well”, I say. “We decided he needed to get some rest.” We don’t talk about it. It is dark. It is a cloud that hangs over our house for weeks. Sometimes, it  isn’t so bad. We have good days. We even have great months. Beautiful months. But it rears it’s ugly head and we know. We know because the house feels tight. The rooms when we’re together feel as though they are squeezing in. It doesn’t care that I need to be touched, or that I need to touch my husband. We don’t talk about it. But we do fight through. We stand back to back. Sometimes, I have to support both of us with my broken emotions and iron love, and that’s okay. I know he realizes all of this, I know because in those good days and great months, I’m treated as a queen. We make love and make memories and we shine. We shine so bright that I know when the dark days come, we’ll fight them. He knows he has me somewhere in those dark, cold days, even if he can’t see or hear me, he knows I’m there. And I know that he’s there, too, still the man I love, the hero of my fairytale. 
The hardest part though, the part that I wish we could change (because depression isn’t something that can just be fixed, I know this); my husband has depression, but we don’t talk about it.

Being the boyfriend.,"My Girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 years. She has suicidal thoughts occasionally. She tells me I am very supportive and a great bf but sometimes I don’t think I’m giving the best support. 

(Sorry for the long post. I don’t know if there’s any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in) 

I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didn’t want anyone to know, so I’ve never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15+ years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom you’re all I got. 

Over the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engaged/married. But we don’t have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we don’t sleep together hardly, we don’t have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me - I’ve tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that I’ve all but given up at this point, even when it’s your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. I’ve tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked she’s gotten worked up and basically says she doesn’t feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever we’ve talked it’s always that she’s not in the mood. I feel like she’s not telling me something. 

I feel as if we’ve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that she’s cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think it’s just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and it’s frustrating me lately. I honestly don’t mean to sound like a jerk here; I’m certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. 

I don’t even know how to explain how I’m feeling. I’m constantly having the internal debate: “Well what about me?”- “Fuck about you! What about her!?” And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 head-spaces.

Headspace A: 
“That being said.. why can’t it be about me sometimes? Shouldn’t a relationship be 50/50? I’ve really never been an attention seeker so I’m fine with 30/70 or 20/80? Anything at this point. It’s not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression.”

Headspace B:
“A few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldn’t breathe, it really freaked me out. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying “she just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die” I love her so much and i’m scared for her and for us.”

Am I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course I’ve never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I don’t say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. I’m just angry at this situation and don’t know how else to react. 

I want our relationship to be what it once was; fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship? How do I bring up my inner man-child who needs her attention or do I bring it up at all?

Learning I have Alexithymia really fucked me up.,"I've always accepted the fact that one day I will kill myself. I joke and say I'm going to kill myself every once in awhile. I've always felt empty and just figured that it was Depression and suicidal thoughts. I promised myself when I was little I would kill myself at 21, I'm 23 now, I'm on meds for depression and I go to a psychiatrist, I have a long term girlfriend who I can see a future with. 

However, that doesn't stop the fact that one day I will kill myself. I told my girlfriend I never want children or marriage because when I do kill myself it'd be easier on everyone. I am getting a vasectomy soon so I don't have any dependents, I've pushed people away, no, I forget other people exist because that's how much no one matters to me.

A few days ago I learned that I have Alexithymia, which means I don't feel emotions. I never had a way of explaining how I feel until I found out what Alexithymia was. 

I have no feelings. I can not experience what I assume is one of the best things about being a human. I have no imagination, no creativity. I simply exist and that's it. Imagine playing a game that's in the first person. That's my life, I just see stuff, I don't feel anything. 

Not to be cliché but I am nothing but a shell of a man. 

This really fucked me up, enough where I stare off, I'm not very talkative and I get lost in my head that life truly is pointless. My girlfriend notices and she's kind of worried, she asked if I would be okay by myself before she left for work. 

I feel like this solidified that life is ultimately pointless, especially for me. 

I only see two options: Kill myself or live in the prison that life is.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Angry Issues Causes Everyone to Leave, Should I Be Alone?","I have always had anger issues and an attitude that no one has ever liked.

Not talking to anyone at all, because if I don't then I can't get angry or show my ugly attitude etc. Part of me just feels terrible and I just dislike who I am as a person.

I desperately want to feel better.,"I felt better this past week but now I’ve slipped back and it feels truly awful.

I only get to talk to my psychologist once a week (on Fridays) and only for like an hour. This sucks because it feels like it’s not enough. (I’m supposed to also go to a psychiatrist, but my parents still haven’t arranged that. [They have to be the ones since I’m still underaged.])

I haven’t been diagnosed so I don’t 100% know what’s wrong with me, but my problems include: Not having any motivation, not having hope for the future, getting irritated very easily over stupid stuff, being terrible at interacting with other humans, barely caring enough about my life to get out of bed, desperately wanting to be left alone for a couple of months, sometimes wanting to kill myself and so on...

I have made two posts already and I guess I’m mostly repeating the same things but I REALLY REALLY WANT ANY HELP / SUPPORT I CAN GET.

I-I don’t know just say something nice in the comments or something. I’m sorry for just begging, but I’m really desperate. I’ve felt like this for the last three months and I can barely take it anymore.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
"I'm looking for advice on helping my depressed and, as I've just learned, suicidal grandma.","So long story short, my grandma is an alcoholic, she's depressed, and she's revealed to me today that she wishes she was dead all the time.  She's tried for a long time these help herself, to get out of her addiction to alcohol and cigarettes, but she really can't do it herself.  She fell today (and has multiple times before) after drinking heavily, and it took a while to get her back up due to her obesity. This was when she told me she wishes she was dead. I told her that she doesn't wish that and she's not thinking clearly because she's drunk, and she told me she feels the same way when she's sober. I know that to have suicidal thoughts, you aren't thinking clearly by definition. I didn't explain that to her though.  A lot of my family struggles with addiction and depression, and I'd say my grandma is in a better state than most of them.

"Help me, please. I have 0 friends in the literal sense. I have been living like this for more than 3 years","I am putting aside every homework I have to write this. And just before you think anything else while reading this, I HAVE NEVER AND HOPEFULLY NEVER WILL THINK ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE, I FEAR DEATH. I also don't pretend anyone to completely read this, I just want to get this weight off somewhere and that this remains as a testimony for anyone who can identify with it and if you do read it you have my gratitude, it's not much but it's the most I can give right now.

I am a 20 year old male currently in University studying what I like. Physically, I consider myself to be average, but sometimes I hate what I see in the mirror and sometimes I like what I see in it. Mirrors are a source of unhappiness for me and even if I try to escape my home's mirrors I will often open the camera app of my phone to look at me and take pictures of my face because I don't feel comfortable with what I see. I have hundreds of selfies just to look and to analyze my face and I always get angry if I don't like what I see.

I don't know how much the last thing is related to the following thing, but I am a very timid, shy and silent person however I never have a frown in my face in public because I am always open to talk to anyone because I really need someone to talk to me (I thank and appreciate virtual messages and conversations but I need a real life interaction). I feel guilty because sometimes I transmit this feeling of helplessness, sadness and misery to my dad and my brother and I know my dad thinks there's something wrong with me and I know he is shy to talk to me about it. I am in misery right now, the last real person (who isn't from my family) who I talked with was last September and I still can't consider him my friend because I know how real and genuine friendships feel like judging from my childhood good friendships, I miss those friendships but those persons are now far away, now have a life of their own with girlfriends and friends. I try to contact my first and old friends in Facebook and although they enthusiastically answer we can never get together, and even if we could I would be so embarassed to share with them what my life has become.

I have learned to live with it, especially after I got psychological support for some months last semester and even if talking to a therapist was a great relief I felt it was useless. When I was in therapy I was reading at the same time some books of self-improvement but that only created in me a temporary but potent energy and when this energy disappeared I returned to this drab, insipid state. 

I was in a very decent social circle when I was in school  (I am not from the US so this will be difficult to explain), I studied where the rich people and the children of important persons of my country studied so I had what you call ""good connections"" and in here you start with the same classmates when you are 3 years old and end with the same classmates when you are 17-18 so we graduate very close to each other emotionally. I feel like I have left that circle and I can't return, I dread that situation of me presenting myself again to those persons and it feels that as years pass they get closer together while I isolate myself more. 

My mom always says that University is the best time of the life because you party, go with friends are more independent, and you begin to flourish, grow up and create good or bad experiences. Not for me, I feel like I am in standby, I just watch people have fun. Today I observed my classes to see if there was anyone else like this but everyone had at least one person to talk to. You may say that it is ok to not party if you don't like (although I do like to party from times to times and get drunk, it's just there isn't anybody I can do that with) and even if I didn't like to go to clubs I see everyone with different interests and mindsets forming groups according to what they like, WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I AM NOT PART OF ANY GROUP??? I feel like I don't have any identity that I can show, I feel empty because I have a big fear of being judged for what I am. I want to start giving a fuck but I can't. I fear sharing my musical and literary tastes even to my parents and my brothers.

My parents are constantly pressing me to create ""contacts"" that will help me in the future and I feel bad for not doing this because it's like I am missing half of the university experience. 

I have reached the point where I prefer Mondays over Fridays and Saturdays because I don't have the pressure from anyone to hang out with someone, in fact I now dread Fridays and Saturdays. 

I feel that if I continue in this state I will get ill (like as in an actual disease), I am the living proof that humans NEED social interactions and are a SOCIAL species, I am getting desperate, I want someone with whom I can share my musical tastes, my fascination for books, football (soccer), history, to have deep conversations, someone who has my trust just as once my old friends had mine and I had theirs, someone to go on adventures AND TO LIVE LIFE.

I am now so embarrassed of myself that I CAN'T LOOK AT MY DAD INTO HIS EYES, my dad is a very compassionate and good person, but I can't look at him to his eyes when we talk, I simply can't. I have problems showing affection even to my parents (who I deeply love but I can't externalize that feeling) and I don't want to be like this, I want to have the courage to say ""I love you"" directly from my mouth and to be able to feel it truly, I want to have the courage to hug someone without getting uncomfortable, to say nice things when I feel them, to stop being a pessimist piece of shit and finally be happy at least for one entire day.  

I perfectly know my my mom and dad and I know they think to themselves: ""When will this guy bring a girl or organize a party""? I know they think this and I am sorry I don't have the bravery to speak to them about my problems. My brothers are also very nice to me but they also have their shit together and I know they also ask to themselves ""Why is he like this""? 

I want the power to love, I am a Roman Catholic and every night and morning I pray, read the Bible and ask to God to give me the power to be happy and give me the gift of love and hope, to remove my extreme anxiety, I want to receive true love but I also want to give true love, I have been assisting to some masses in the Church near my university and I have cried when the priest meditates some passages I can identify with or gives us the command to offer each other the sign of peace because it's the only thing that I feel that loves me. 

The only thing that keeps me going is that I know I am in my most critical moment and when things start to get better or I am at my peak in life I want to be able to look back to these moments and say ""wow, that was really my lowest point"" to never repeat it again.

Thank you, dear stranger, if you took part of your busy day to read this and I will be attentive to any advice you can give to me.

"I don't have anything, no future and just.. yeah.","I don’t know where to start so I guess I give my life story.  My father left me as a baby, and my mother lost custody at some point. Therefore, my grandparents had gain custody of me. For the most part, my early childhood was normal until around a certain age I was molested by an older female family member that had also extended to one of my female neighbour doing the same thing.  At the time, I did not understand this or knew anything, but they as did. This didn’t impact me at; first, I was too young to understand, but as I got older I was lashing out a lot more, mainly to the female gender.  At first, I didn’t realize this, and I’ve never told anyone what happened either.  I felt ashamed, scared I get in trouble and no one would believe me. 

&amp;#x200B;

As years went on, I grew to be more of an oddball person, an outcast among my peers. I did not get along with the female gender, and I didn’t care until I hit puberty. Around this time, I’m still super awkward and bully by everyone. I didn’t have many friends, maybe 2-3 and this stayed until high school. Up until this point, never had a girlfriend and didn’t know how to approach any girl for it. My self-confidence is long shot with abandonment issues. Most of my family thinks I’m gay and I’m still bullied.   

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, to all of this, I have developed depression. As a teenager, I look around and see people hooking up but not this guy. At home, I had several relatives just killing my confidence, saying I was gay; saying I would never amount to anything and so on. I also have , and my family stopped getting medication for it. So now, even at school, I’m struggling, staying in one spot in subjects I’m not a huge fan? Yeah, it was not great, and I ended up skipping a lot.  To this day, I can’t ever get any medication for it either, but I save that little later.

&amp;#x200B;

By 12th grade, my grandfather had passed away, and he was the only thing I had to father like. My depression hits me harder and I just no longer had any desire for school. I begin skipping so much school that I was dropped from the program. I only stayed home, watch t.v and played video games.  I get a job and I stayed there for five years. Naturally I find other work over time and keep going with jobs I hate.  I move in with my mother at some point,  I thought it be a good idea and grow closer to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother goes on to lie and steal from me the entire time I’m with her. I had even tried to go back to school and get my GED but told down a lot. I pay money for something, and they would pocket it. I would sleep, and they steal my credit card and spend my entire paychecks. I was often treated like a third class citizen while living with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

While attending GED school, it a massive struggle for me. I can’t focus longer than 30 minutes and only a few times a week if that. I still have no medication to get back on or a way to get them. To this day,  I’m quite afraid to ever try for it, in thinking I’m making it up, you last this long why now you need them.  So yeah,  I don’t ever get it and it always…just something I hate myself for. I just feel like I’m lazy and crap because I can’t focus on. I did end up getting half of the credits credit for GED, where I am at you don’t have to take all the test at once. You can take each test one at a time. I’m only needing math and science which both I have a tough time focusing on. Both take the longest to learn and hardest for me to stay still for. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, I grow homeless and then move into with a relative and then kicked out after getting a bunch of money from me. Then I move back in with my grandmother who pretty much hates me or feels like it. Most of my life she told me I never do anything or amount to anything and honestly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began pro wrestling and been in for about 4-5 years now, but I don’t even have that anymore because of my limit of travel. I’m unable to drive, and I have anxiety trying to drive on an actual street.  I have no reliable ride for it and because of my limitations; I will never get far for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only relationships I’ve had is online ones, and each one never led to meeting in real life. Don’t get me wrong, I wanted too and tried to get there, but it never does. There always an excuse for each person I’ve been with and even recently it has happened. I got no confidence to try a person face to face. But at least with an online relationship, I don’t feel as lonely and keeps some depression away. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, that my life story and how I became who I am now. I do not have anything to look forward to in the morning, and I curse at myself for now randomly dying in my sleep. I feel like shit and the thoughts of suicidal grows stronger with each day.  Make matters worse,  it has become easier for me to gain weight and harder to lose weight as I age. So every time I eat, I just feel awful.  I’m going bald, my vision and my hearing is getting worse.  Often told I look like a 40-year-old man or something.  

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, I can’t even work longer than 20 hours, and even then it feels like it pushing it. Every time I work longer than those hours I get so stressed out and my depression grows worse. I could get more hours, but when I do, I feel worse about myself. But because I don’t my family looks further down on me. I look down on myself, I feel like this waste of space lazy piece of shit.  I just don’t know what to do anymore, I just feel like anything I try or will ever try will be meaningless. I feel like I’m constantly in an endless void, like stuck in the middle of the sea while unable to swim. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I try to find love, it can only be online and they will always have zero interest in meeting the real me.  So it will always be the same result just a different person. If I try to further my education, I can’t ever stay focus enough to make any progress and that always repeat. If I work more I feel more stress  out about everything and grow more depress. If stay where I am, I’m constantly being looked down on and be called lazy. I’m growing older and fatter, I don’t have anything or able to gain nothing. I do not know what do anymore and taking my own life is constantly feel like the best solution to end the madness.

"Boyfriend broke up with me a week after I got a shocking diagnosis, says my mood was too bad lately","hi,

frankly I'm here to hear some motivational words. I've been suffering from depression since I was a child, this was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. I've been feeling better for a while. However, after I got with my boyfriend it definitely got better. Now last week I got the shocking diagnosis, that I might not be able to get pregnant naturally because of an undetected infection that I had at some point and I'm going to surgery in a month due to chronic pain as consequence of this infection. I've been really depressed, angry and frustrated lately. I just think that this could have been detected sooner, as I've had pain in my lower abdomen for a while. On top of this, I'm really stressed from university because I have to do a lot of homework and also work. My boyfriend of 2 1/2 months just broke up with me because he said that I've been in a bad mood and he feels affected by this. I can't believe that he would just leave me at a time like this. He's shown 0 empathy for my situation and always said I should stop 'feeling grumpy'. I mean honestly. I moved out of my student housing room during the weekend to go live at my dad's place during this difficult time and discovered that there is mold in my room now. I just feel like I can't catch a break and wonder how I can deal with this. 

I'm so shocked because he always told me he loves me more than I him and that he really adores me. And now this. I mean it's good that I know this now after such a short time rather than later. No one can use a partner that won't be there for them during difficult times. I'm just having a hard time grasping this situation. I feel even worse now that he told me his reason for breaking up was that my mood had been too bad lately. I am afraid that I will be back to my major depression due to the course of these events. I'm probably gonna phone some therapists soon so that I can deal with this  situation better, as I fear that I might self-harm.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

I don’t know why I’m seeking help here but please just read as much as you can...,"So I’m 15 and for most of my life I’ve been treated not badly but like I’m really different as if there were something wrong with me  (pretty much only in school since kindergarten). Other than that I’ve always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan (my mums side, ill get to why that’s important later) was diagnosed with dementia (other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody). In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years (when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeks/months old) suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didn’t have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months (tear down my face as I’m writing this). The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died (I still don’t have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened), and although I don’t feel sad about not having him as I’m used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives (although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times). There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder (I will say I don’t think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up). There’s heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when I’m not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion (I know he’s a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans). I’m failing at school since year 8 and I’m always feeling worried about how I went in a test or having 1000 bricks on my chest scared what my mum will say when she sees how I went. I spent the entire 2nd half improving and trying my best especially in English where my teacher would repeatedly remind me I’m an intelligent kid but I’m just lazy, and when I thought I had improved I went from the first semester being all C’s and turned it into C’s and one D. I can’t focus on anything important in class, I can’t remember stuff and it feels like everything I’ve explained in this post is coming together and ruining my life, making me feel hopeless and giving me a feeling of life being pointless. My ideal life right now would be one where I can stay home all day without worrying about any responsibilities or having to deal with my peers or school. Being around people seems to make me feel more lonely. Being around family im almost always happy. Avoiding all of these things feels like it would make me feel great again even though me in my right mind would’ve hated the idea of being alone at home all day with my “boring” parents. I don’t know what to do. I want to see a doctor deep down but i also don’t want to know if there’s something wrong, I don’t want to do the whole medication and therapy thing. I just want to be a normal kid who can be happy and out there like I used to be. I’m sorry for talking so much but I just wanted to let it all out and ask if people think these are signs that I should seek help. Maybe if there’s anybody going through something similar to me who has been diagnosed. Any sign to help me know what’s wrong with me because I want to seek help but I don’t want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me I’m just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse. At this point I don’t know what I’m talking about but I just don’t want to keep feeling like this. If this isn’t depression then I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to have to deal with this horrible feeling in my body anymore.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Prozac worries,"I got prescribed 10 mg of Prozac today and I was doing some research about Serotonin Syndrome ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin\_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)). Basically it's a very severe condition that can occur when people mix SSRIs like Prozac and other serotonergic drugs. This left me with a couple of questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Dextromorphethan is one of the drugs that can interact with SSRIs to cause the syndrome. I recently had a bad cough and took a lot of it. Also, I dropped acid in the last 3 months, which also can cause the syndrome when mixed with SSRIs. Am I at risk? I haven't had any drug of any sort for two weeks, and don't plan to while on Prozac, but I can't help but fear that any latent amount of these drugs in still my system could kill me when I start taking Prozac.

&amp;#x200B;

Would appreciate any insight.

"why do I feel a void, or a hole in my chest?","Disclaimer: I am sorry if this post doesn’t fit, but I’ve tried posting elsewhere and haven’t gotten help. I have not been diagnosed with depression nor have I felt as if I did before.


To start, I watched this video on YouTube after scrolling through my recommendations for a bit.

https://youtu.be/mB_0FXiFHd0
To be honest, I thought it was pretty sad, and it spoke to me in a way I’ve never felt.
Afterwards, I began to feel an emotional hole in my chest, or, a void. I’m not sure what feeling this video triggered, but it’s happened to me only a few times before, and it’s never been this bad. Going on 6 days now, whenever i think of the girl in the video, I think of the song and what she went through. I feel it. It doesn’t matter where I am, what I am doing, or who I’m with. I’ve also began to feel less motivated to do things in my pastime. As a naive junior in h/s, I’m really not sure what to make of all this.  Help would be much appreciated.

Self-Improvement help,"After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I don't want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it: it's no big deal, I can't justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship.

The problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything.

I also believe that it was not only lack of communication / confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I don't have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didn't want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped.

I am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but it's like I can't help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I don't force myself to change.

Probably, right now I should focus on getting out of the post-breakup depression (filling the void she left, new hobbies, activities...) and move on but there is a lot in me I'd like to improve, just to name a few:

\- Manage &amp; control emotions better - as you can gather from all the previous

\- Be more confident: My confidence is not the worst but I find it lacking most of the time

\- Have better human relationships: As I mentioned I don't have too many friends. I usually have a hard time accepting new people into my life. Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work (not real friendships). I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert ""adopted"" him. Never a post has spoken so much to me.

\- Social anxiety: Not super bad in my case but I tend to get anxious in large groups, especially if I don't know anyone. I tend to feel uncomfortable and out of place.

\- Be less clingy: I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points.

I have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe I've seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or self-help books? Courses? Seeing a psychologist or some other kind of therapy?

High functioning depression,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking in depression subreddits for a while but I finally decided to post.

I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but since I started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when I open up about my depression. Even when I talked about my PTSD from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me.

I shower two times a day every day, I finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and I make sure I get near perfect grades on everything, I work 5-6 days a week, I'm a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else I panic. My anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive.

I've had people who tell me my depression ""isn't real"" because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. When I talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts I was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression. 

I felt like screaming that depression is not a contest. It ruins lives and there is no ""one size fits all"" depression.

I just need support that my struggles are valid.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
Does anyone else feel like the saturation in their life is turned down?,"The best way I can describe how I feel is: feeling as if someone has turned down the saturation in my life.

I can feel emotions. When I’m with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the happiest) I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I can’t seem to get past a 5 at most. It’s like my brain is saying “this is funny you should laugh and feel happy” but I just don’t feel that? At least not fully. It’s like my 5 is other people’s 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much they’re in tears and can’t catch their breath I’m only chuckling, even though I *know* the situation is funny. I can’t even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile it’s like i’m not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smile/laugh the outside physically changes but inside I don’t feel anything. It almost feels as if I’m acting but I’m not because I do know the situation is funny. It’s like there’s a disconnect somewhere. It’s hard to explain. 

And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyance/anger and sadness, but even that’s toned down, not saturated, lifeless.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do I make a female partner who's depressed feel better?,"(**repost because i forgot to use my alt)**

Hey guys. So I'm hanging out with my girlfriend on Friday, who is depressed and may have some sort of bpd issues (as pointed out by multiple redditors). They have been irritable and angry for a long time, and there's a lot on her mind, so I'm giving them the week without talking to her to recollect her. I was hoping to get everyone's advice on how I should talk to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make clear that they does not think she's depressed, but all symptoms are there. irritability, feeling of emptiness, mood swings, sadness, (sometimes) excessive substance intake. they even admitted they were depressed a while ago and had thoughts of killing or harming herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried about her and if she won't accept and get help herself, I'm trying to see how I can make things better. The stuff I have planned out on Friday are:

1. I surprise her by letting her choose what I get her for valentine's day
2. We cuddle and watch a movie or something
3. She goes out with some friends who are moving away
4. when she's back, we hang out again and maybe watch our favorite tv show.
5. play some kind of video game or just talk

Are any of you able to tell me what else I can do to make my partner feel happier? Like whether it's daily or what I can just do on Friday. I want her to come out of her rut and be happy like she was once before. I'm really trying to make it fun but not suffocate her. We've been fighting a lot lately and it got pretty bad so I'm willing to do whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

Just need to rant a little bit,"I've always been someone who bottles up my thoughts, problems and feelings. I know that it's a shitty way of dealing with things but oh well... It's come back to bite me in the arse now. 
I'm a senior so uni is coming up later this year. I'm having so much trouble planning my future, choosing what to study etc. I was thinking of having a gap year, but my country is changing some stuff which will make it much harder for me to get in 2020, so I should apply this year instead. My finals are coming up really soon and I'm so terrified of not doing well. 
And I don't know if I'm just imagining things but it feels like things are falling apart with my best friends too. It feels like they're ganging up together against me, to pick on me and freeze me out. Everytime I hang out with them I feel extra depressed, but at the same time I feel guilty for being a downer. No one's asked me how I'm doing, but I also don't want to dump my problems onto anyone. It feels like my friends wouldn't care anyway. So much has changed, they've changed so much since the first year. I feel like I can't trust them anymore. My boyfriend cheated on me a few months ago so our relationship ended, and I feel really lonely. I just want to cry and isolate myself from the world. I hate myself for being like this.

Dealing with toxic parents and mental illnesses," I have a friend whom I'm doing my best to support. She has grave issues with her family.

Her father is extremely toxic, he calls her names, does not allow certain things, picks on her physically. Her little sister has learned this behavior from her father and does the same thing, but more often.

Actually, she hates to stay home and spends her days outside or someplace like a cafe, college, rpg clubs.

She has ridiculously low self-esteem and can't see anything good in her life. Looks like she gets really happy and emotional if I take a walk with her, invite her for lunch or just chat with her, but reality hits her harder and I can't be there for her every time.

Moreover, she has mental illnesses like anxiety and panic attacks that are provoked by extreme emotions (happiness, fear, sadness) and need medication to fight it. It appears that she had a few attempts to take her life...

Is there a good way for a depressed person to deal with a toxic family? No, moving out is not an option since finances are scarce.

HS ruined my life,"HS was the start of several problems to my mental health, stress, anxiety, social problems (and bad grades with it too as a consequence)... Everything started back on the 31st of October of last year when we were having a party in our class because of Halloween, then two bullies entered the classroom, and basically changed my life. There was a bully episode that day, and was the consequence of me changing the section of the class, which means changing classmates and teachers. I made the right choice as I was constantly harrassed by the old classmated and the teachers were bad, like, really bad. So I changed the section, and I thought everything was back to normal. I was wrong. I find it hard to even study now. I can't force myself into doing nothing. Literally nothing. There is nothing I can do even to go to school. It's really fucking hard. I failed my mom. I failed everyone and what I wanted to be. I find myself in the situation where I cry a lot thinking about this. I am a failure. My mom had faith in me. There is still people that love me. My grandparents, my mom, everyone in my family. Except I haven't talked about it to any one of them. I think it would be embarrassing because they can't understand what it's like to be like this. I expect an answer like ""you're too young"". And they are almost right, except depression can be found at any age. I'm having a mental breakdown, seriously. 

As I said before, I struggle when I want to force myself into doing things, like homework or just study. I just want to end it right now. The only thing that makes me sad about it is what my family will think about. It not gonna be their fault. I even failed them. They were never strict with me, always there to love me. But now everything has changed, I'm a disappoint to them even though I don't know it already. They know nothing about my mental state. It's hard guys. Life is hard. And meaningless.

I need some help,"When I was 13 years old suffered from bullying at school and I had depression for a long time, my parents knew about it because I put a lot of suicidal stuff on my facebook and I had a friend of my dad on my friends list, so she saw it, talked to me and after she called my parents. They helped me (more my mom) and they took me out of school. 
But my parents started to say that it was a shame, that everyone would find out about my depression and they wanted to take all of my social medias so no one will know I’m sick.

I study at university and things have become EXTREMELY difficult,"I’m a university student and recently things have become really tough. There are several problems that I’ve got no idea how to solve:

1. Social anxiety: it’s insanely stressful for me to interact with people. My classmates are girls and I’m the only guy in the group so it makes interactions even harder cause I try to be nice with them. Sometimes I get random panic attacks (dizziness, increased heartbeat, sweaty and trembling palms) that make it impossible to talk to anyone or even to keep up with what the teacher is saying during lectures. Moreover, I cannot even approach my crush, cause this girl is very cute and adorable
2. Irritated bowel syndrome: this thing makes my life like ten times harder. I have to endure extreme pain all the time and I also often get late for classes. Recently one of my teachers (he’s not aware of this problem) has told me that he won’t let me in for the class if I get even a minute late ever again. IBS + panic attacks also make things like public speaking extremely difficult
3. Conscription: the main reason I study at university is to avoid it. For me conscription is constant beating, humiliation, shitty food, life without sleep and weekends and being in a tough environment 24/7. My health is not good enough to endure conscription, I just won’t stand it. Also if I’m gonna have a girlfriend, she is not gonna wait for me to return. Most girls here break up with their boyfriends if those get conscripted.

There are several other problems like studying in the faculty that I don’t like but cannot change faculty because here it’s almost impossible. Psychological help is also very expensive and mostly useless here so for me it’s not an option.

What am I supposed to do to solve it? How can I make this life better?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Gf won't get help because she doesn't want to change,"I'm at a complete loss here. I (27f) suffer from depression and anxiety myself. I'm having trouble reaching out for help, but I'm slowly building the courage  and doing self help because I want to get better and be a happy person.

Last night my girlfriend (28f) who has been struggling for a while told me that she's in a really dark place. When I started to lead the discussion into getting help or even just a little self help, she just gave me a flat out no. She's been suffering for years and the various meds and therapy she goes through just help her for a little while and then she goes back to depression.

She says she doesn't want to be different. She doesn't want to work on being happy because then she isn't herself. Doesn't like the feel of being on meds because she isn't herself. She's fine just accepting being depressed as her default state and one day when she's tired of living she'll end it all. She doesn't want to end it now so she's not eligible to be hospitalised. But she is calm and completely certain that eventually she will kill herself.

I don't know what to do with such clear and calm certainty. She struggles with similar things that I do. I try to give the answers that hope are true. ""what's the point of living when all we do is work and sleep to pay for a place we never use because we're working or sleeping"" ""I'm not worth saving"" ""nobody cares"" etc, but she just refutes it and stays where she is.

Problem is, I leave the country in the next 6 months (so we've always known our relationship has an expiry date) and she has no support network. She has no family and very few friends that are in a position to help out. She's spent quite a lot of time homeless in the past. I don't know what to do. It feels like she only wants to get better if it happens organically, but that is a rarity.

TL;DR gf won't get help. She doesn't want to be on meds/therapy because it means she isn't herself, so it's kinda like she just wants to be depressed with the idea that eventually she will kill herself

Lost in a rabbit hole @_@,"Hi, I'm 23 years old and I tend to feel like I'm wasting time. 

I stopped going to college at the end of 2017, I didn't go back for the fall semester. I found two pretty good jobs until they both laid me off, due to the fact that they were only seasonal. After that I havent felt like filling out applications, instead I've been pursuing my dream job. I want to be a journalist and lately I've been so far down the rabbit hole of story writing I feel like I nearly lost touch with reality. 

I know in order to learn you have to fail over and over and that's how I feel. At the same time I feel like I've been spending way too much time writing and researching I forgot when the last time I talked to another human being. Im not that close to my family and I only have a couple friends, who seem to be busy most of the time.

When I'm not obsessing with writing I catch myself day dreaming about a perfect world where I go out on the weekends and have fun. I have never really experienced that and the thought makes me feel alone or that this humanity. People are just words on a screen now.

If anyone has any tips please let me know!","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
I want to go home,"I (F, 19) am a sophomore in college. I have a wonderful family-- my three siblings and I are extremely close, and our parents love us and each other. I know I'm very lucky for that. 

I grew up on a small farm in the desert, and we were dirt poor. Our house was a hundred years old and was built from adobe and railroad ties. The plywood floors had holes in them that snakes and mice would come through, and my sister and I shared a bed until I was twelve. I remember times when all we had to eat was what we had left over from the previous harvest and the animals we had raised. My summers were spent working our land and taking trips with my friends from church and school to the muddy river that only flowed with the snowmelt in the spring and the torrential monsoons in the summer. We always had dogs and barn cats and chickens. It was so simple and easy, and I loved that farm and my life with my whole heart. When I was 15, we moved to a city a few hours away and kept the farm. We'd go up on weekends to take care of little projects, and I would get to see the friends I'd grown up with. I never felt like I had really moved away.

I've since started college in a town much closer to my farm, and I go to visit often. My dad stayed up there for work and stays in a trailer we brought up. He takes care of our chickens and farms in the warmer months. Our work weekends are more scattered now that all the kids are grown and moved away.

Our house is uninhabitable now and the land is going wild again. Coming home just isn't the same anymore. Lately, all I want, and all I can think about, is to go home. Not just making the drive and seeing my dad and the farm. 

I fantasize about waking up in the morning in my bed, 10 again, snuggled with my sister against the cold and the wind howling outside. I want to be with my family the way we were when we all lived under the same roof and to work in the garden and take walks through the desert with my brother, looking for elk and coyote tracks in the river basin. I want to hear the native languages I grew up hearing, but not understanding, in school again. I want to go back to the nights when we didn't have enough money to pay our electricity bill and my mom and dad would bring out the oil lamps and our domino set and we'd play games and read by the lamplight and just enjoy each others company. 

I miss my dad coming home from work, bone-tired and smelling like the propane he would fill train cars with for transport and the way he'd give me a big hug and a snuggle before he went to bed. I miss the tiny town I went to school in and the way I believed in the church I went to whole-heartedly. I miss going to the Fourth of July Rodeo a few towns over. I miss my mom making us oatmeal pancakes and homemade buttermilk syrup on mornings we'd go out to the juniper stands and cut wood for the winter. 

I go to sleep at night hoping that when I wake up, that is where I am. I wake up in the morning devastated that instead, I've woken up in my apartment to an alarm clock and have to get ready for school and then work. Absolutely devastated. I don't know how to get over it. I am just existing. I can't find joy in anything. I feel like my life has no purpose and that I'm just going through the motions. I'm terrified of the day that one of my family members dies. I'm scared that one day something will happen and we won't see each other again. That I'll come back to the farm and find that everything we'd built is gone and that I will never find comfort. I am at a loss of what to do. 

I don't know what I want from this post, but I just needed to put these words down and get them off my chest. My parents would be distraught if they knew I was so sad. I just really don't know what to do. If you're still reading this, thank you.

Should I use the psychological help service that my university provides for free?,"Lately I've been feeling really low. 
I can't make myself leave the bed, I start crying out of the blue and everything is just so heavy. 
I think I've always suffered from some kind of depression but I've never been to therapy because I couldn't afford it on my own and my family didn't ever suspect anything. 
Now I live on my own in another city. Yesterday I discovered that my university provides psychological help for students for free. Do you think I should give it a go? 
I'm a bit afraid because I don't know what to expect and I don't really know what to tell them when I'll be there. I know they don't provide help for very serious issues (you'll need a psychiatrist for that) and I hope they don't take care for only ""university related problems"".
On the other hand, I have nothing to lose because it's free.
Did you ever try anything like that?

"How do I muster the energy to cook and eat, especially at the end of the day?","Does anyone have tips or psychological tricks for getting yourself to eat regularly, especially at dinner?

I’m pretty good about eating on days when I have classes (college student). I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused (and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing). I always have a healthy big breakfast.

My problem is with weekends and dinner. I’m usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if it’s just microwaving leftovers.

I also live with others - I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really don’t want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I can’t always rely on his presence. Or if I’m out with friends and we’re getting fast food I can eat because I don’t have to put in any effort and I’m outside anyways.

And weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I don’t feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry.

Can anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? 

When I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college :(

I find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason. It’s really easy to drop a few pounds when I’m under additional stress; some weeks I just can’t do dinners at all.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
17 year old forced to stop Paxil 20mg cold turkey. Looking for Advice!,"I was very recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well as anxiety, anxiety related insomnia, and severe depression from the previous improper diagnosis of Bipolar ii, and I was taking Paxil 20mg for 2 months.

Cutting,"Hello,

Yesterday I cut myself, on my arm. I'm wondering how it will heal?

I feel terrible about it, and really don't want anyone to see my arm. But I can't hide it forever, and my girlfriend will see it eventually. I can hide it from other people, but not her. I just wanted to escape my thoughts but they have only turned worse as a result of what I did. Usually I'll just hit my knuckles into walls, until I physically can't do it anymore. But that heals faster, from what I've heard this can take a while.

I’ve done nothing of note, not even watching a movie or going to the grocery store, the only times I’ve left my house are for sports practice which I **dread** and just despise.

I'm alone.,"I'm lost. I'm afraid. I'm worthless. I have no one in my life anymore, bar one friend who lives on the opposite side of the world. I lost my boyfriend yesterday. He broke up with me because my depression was bringing him down. I understand, I guess, but the last thing I could ever have wanted or needed was my boyfriend to leave me, he was my rock, and he cheered me up even on my worst days.

I have no family. They never wanted much to do with me, especially when I started developing mental health issues 8 years ago. They slowly but surely made their way out of my life and upset me in the most awful ways.

I have no friends. I moved into university and left my friends at home, and I really struggled to make new friends here. I have one, my flatmate, but that's it, no one else wants anything to do with me. I'm even considering moving back home to a mother who really dislikes me and made my life a living hell, I can't stay here at uni. 

I have no one left. I have no reason to live anymore. I've fought for so long, and surprisingly, I think I can say I'm currently at the lowest part of my life, and I have gone through and done a tonne of shit.

My problems are ruining my relationships. (I’ve also realized that I really don’t like myself.),"Like a month ago I’ve met a girl and we’ve been texting every day since then.

She has a very good influence on me. 
My problems (stress, sadness, anxiety etc.) are getting easier to deal with thanks to her.

But feeling better naturally comes with worrying about losing this “goodness”... a lot...

I worry about losing her so much that it’s probably not having a very good impact on our relationship...


Even though I feel better that doesn’t mean I’m totally fine.

I still get these waves of [insert any of my problems here].

We very often argue when this happens.

I’m extremly worried that this will end up ruining my relationship with her.

She will not like me anymore if I keep having these waves...


Yesterday we were talking and she brought up how I have very low self-esteem. 

She wanted to help so she recommended something that has helped her with her self-esteem issues.

Go to a mirror and say “I love myself.”

I was almost unable to do this... I mean- I said it but I didn’t belive it and it made me feel way worse because I didn’t think it was THIS BAD...

Then I realized how much I don’t like myself...

I’ve felt like shit because of that since yesterday. (It’s getting better today, thankfully.)


She probably isn’t too happy about having to deal with me in these situations...


I’m not sure what to do... I really don’t want to lose her because of this...

Talk about depression in job interview?,"Hey guys,

I've been subject to a lot of depression episodes recently, which really sucks because I'm currently actively looking for a job. I started kind of taking care of my depression a few months ago, but I still experience really bad days (suicidal thoughts and such).

The things is, before fully dedicating myself to finding a job, I decided to take a few months off. This means I would allow myself to put my job research on hold while *really* taking measures to work on my depression for the first time in my life. 

The problem I'm facing now during job interviews is the dreaded question ""But what have you been doing for the past 5 months? I see no job experience, no nothing."" with the nice tone of voice ""Have you been doing fuck all? ♥""

I was thus wondering, what would a good answer be to that sort of question?

Cus I'm not sure giving the depression background during an interview would really help my case, and on another end,  I've not been doing ""fuck all"", just not what they want to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really lost on this point, cus I really want to start working again. I feel like it would be the next step toward winning over this freaking depression.

I don't want to lie during a job interview, because I feel it would give a bad start to a possible work partnership, but on another hand, should I?

&amp;#x200B;

Did you guys ever had to face that situation before?

Any beginning of answer would really help!

Teenager with no hope.," I'm a senior in high school right now, and as far as I can tell, I have a bleak future, and an even bleaker present. I'm too lazy to get grades better than C's, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking I've found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, and I doubt anyone thinks of me. It's gotten so bad, I don't even like to listen to music anymore, something I used to look forward to a little while ago, now it just seems like unnecessary noise. Every time someone asks what college I'm going to and I reply with \[X\] Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Don't get me wrong, I've had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didn't mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this. I'm not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. Wow, I sound like a pretentious asshole reading this back. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did.

Why do I even bother?,"I never get any replies on this subreddit, but here I am again prostrating myself to all who dare to read my post!

depressed piece of shit,"I am a young adult who lives in New York- I grew up with fully supporting parents and friends, but that means nothing when your mental health is not stable. The last year of my life I have been battling with severe depression and anxiety, and was just recently hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric ward. At this point, I feel so incurable- nothing has helped. I have seen my therapist for a year, seemed professional medical help, took the numerous amount of pills and have not felt the slightest bit better. Things have gotten worse than before. I have laundry piling up in the corner of my room and at this point I just pull out any clean clothes I can find in my dresser. Showers? HA- even a short 5 minute shower seems to take too much energy at this point. AND I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME BULLSHIT LINES OF ""It will get better,"" and ""You have nothing to be depressed about,"" or ""Everything will be fine because it always works out.""

To be honest, my depression has just spiraled out of control at this point. I can't look at myself in the mirror and hate everything about myself- internally, externally and mentally. I hate myself- and the people I am hurting. I could have a good day, but at the end of the day my suicidal thoughts still sit in the back of my head. Sometimes I sit and regret not just doing it- blade to my wrist and a family member walks in. I had the blade in my right hand, resting on my left forearm- and I regret not ending my life there when I had the motherfucken chance.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
What do I tell my boyfriend when I'm in a depressive episode and he asks what's wrong?,"Hey guys, so I need some advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating a guy for a few months &amp; our relationship is going great. We both really care for one another and we're honestly like long-lost friends that have been reunited. Everything in our lives together gels perfectly &amp; I'm excited to see where our future goes. However, there's one thing getting in the way. 

I suffer with major depressive episodes and anxiety. My moods tend to swing awfully and I tend to crash and get quite low quite a lot. My boyfriend tries to help the best he can, but he keeps asking what's wrong or he keeps wanting to talk about it. And I get that, he wants to know what's wrong and how he can help. But I don't have an answer for him besides that my mood has crashed. He wants to know what's on my mind and I don't know what to tell him. 

So, any advice on how I can help calm his worries and my own?

About ready to ghost my mom?,"My mother is a 20+ year TBI survivor due to domestic abuse. As such, her mental standing isn't nearly what it might have been. She has severe memory loss, and personality... inconsistencies. I've been trying to do as much as I can for her, but lately I'm feeling more and more drained.

I bought her a cell phone because she's never home long enough to warrant a landline. I've also replaced it several times when it breaks because she doesn't know what a soft touch is. However, this is where I'm starting to lose hope. 

She enrolled in school, which I'm proud of her for. She turns her phone off per teacher requirements, but never remembers to turn it back on. She texts me most nights, and I can almost recite her texts verbatim. However, as soon as she sends her text, she turns it back off. 

My five year old even knows what grandma does is hurtful. My wife has told her that she's gonna call grandma, and my daughter asked, ""Why? Her phone's off anyway.""  I can go a week, easily, without physically hearing her voice. 

I'm about ready to just delete her number from my phone and ignore her texts, maybe she'll eventually get the hint. I feel like it's a catch 22... if I keep her number it'll just be a reminder that she only wants to talk when it's convenient for her, but if I delete her and show that I'm upset it'll piss off the rest of my family. 

I don't know what to do any more. How do I handle someone who is making absolutely no attempt to meet me halfway? It's like she doesn't care about me or my family any more.

I am a toxic person and I want to not be like this anymore.,"I am a 27 year old man who has recently come to the conclusion that he is toxic. Here's why.

I cannot tell if I do not care about anybody else's feelings other than my own, and I only do things to get something for myself. If I've fucked up in a relationship or I've hurt someone I loved, I apologise. Even if I am right, I apologise because my father taught me that is the way to do things in relationships with people.  I am always the nice guy in the relationships/friendships and I've started to think that I'm just some beta-male that should've been discarded a long time ago. I have no confidence in my social abilities and I often feel lonely as a result, but then when I am with others I usually feel like a black sheep and/or get irritated with the company to the point where I don't want to be around them.

I just got a promotion in my job and didn't even smile or think that it was a good thing. My boss even questioned me if I was happy or excited, to which I replied 'yes' straight-faced. I am confident in my abilities in my job and it is not boring or mundane, but I place no value on it because jobs are something we must do in order to survive. Nothing excites me anymore. I have lost passion for everything. And I just wallow about in self-pity, trying not to become distraught through rage or unhappiness. Until recently I was calling up my parents almost every day enraged or crying with despair. I am sick of dragging everyone down with me because of my emotional outrage.

Thus, I have made the decision to cut off all contact with everyone I know, family included. My gut feeling is telling me to never speak to anyone ever again because I am so sick of trying. Trying to please everyone, trying to better myself, and trying to do anything.

I never take to the internet in search for solutions, but if anyone knows how to change their attitude so that they may continue on the pursuit for happiness, then please, I beg of you, share your wisdom. I don't want to be this person.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm stuck here and nobody likes me (22 F),"(I am a 22 year old English teacher living in Asia for 7 months)

While sitting in the lounge with a group of coworkers, one of them seemingly out of the blue said 'I don't like OP' to my face. I find that whenever I try to speak in group conversations I get talked over. Or I talk into the air with no one listening. I was going to lunch with two people who I consider to be friends, when they agreed they have no idea what I do outside of work and could only say a couple superficial things about me. We go out for drinks, food, etc on a regular basis. . . I live as an expat so your coworkers are everything- they act as your family and friends all in one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been depressed pretty much right after I came here and haven't felt like myself. I used to be the funny, witty person that was complimented for my confidence. Here, I am quiet, awkward, and passive. It has become a spiral where I try to speak up to be more involved, but then no one responds, so I become more insecure and talk less. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still have half a year left before my contract ends and I can leave, so any helpful advice about how I can improve my situation would be appreciated.

Burned out and trying to come back from it,"First time posting here. Looking for incite on things.

Backstory: I'm in a weird place in my life right now. I just turned 30, and there have been events in my life that I want to get over. I could itemize the events but it's more about my feelings about them that I want to move on from. I was a social work student but I dropped out because it was emotionally draining. And across a lot of different areas of my life I need to cope with things. 

I feel defeated and ashamed of myself. I feel like I dream too big and can't attain those dreams. I feel pain from society and how people treat me and each other. I'm sick and tired of the hate we all do to each other. We are all in pain for different reasons in life. I feel like it's pain for seeing how the world is and wishing that these conversations would start to get visibly better. I scroll Reddit because of how amazing/funny/beautiful things can be. I think I'm too weighed down from seeing so much pain. 

I got divorced a year ago and all of my friends and I lost touch. My ex was a good person most of the time but he did some pretty abusive stuff too. And so I'm dealing with grief of people no longer being in my life that I liked having around but that I had to say goodbye to in a way so that my life could try to get better.

I want the grief to heal. I want my self worth to heal back. I'm tired emotionally and I know I'll get back on my feet. There's so many reasons to feel sad about anything or everything. But what do you do next once you know that? Knowing there's endless reasons for things to be bad or to be good. I feel drained like it's some sort of mental gravity not sure how to describe it but almost like I've been working myself too hard. Things will get better but I need to figure out how to heal myself inside.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I feel like a failure, because I'm failing to get certain things done","I am really struggling with certain aspects of my life, I can't get motivated. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been receiving various forms of therapy for the past two years since my son was born. I believe that I have suffered with depression since way before my son was born but the signs weren't recognised until I was being seen by a health professional regularly.

I am very lucky to have a roof over my head, a loving husband and a full time job. However, I cannot seem to escape the void of depression. Currently I'm in a the crippling pit, and I cannot motivate myself with certain things. I don't take my medication, I know I should but I have some sort of mental block that stops me taking it. My work is suffering because I've found a way to get by, doing the day to day tasks but not doing my daily reports. I would describe myself as high functioning depressed as I can get out of bed and get dressed, but the only reason I do this is my son.

I live with my husband and in laws and I've just realised that I'm not happy anywhere. I'm not happy at work, I'm not happy at home. I get on well with my in laws but they drive me crazy by parenting my son. At work I feel out of my depth and like I'm just winging it, badly.

I just want to escape, and the only way I can think of to escape is suicide but I can't bear the thought of not seeing my son grow up. He is my lifeline but what kind of mother is he growing up with?

I cannot motivate myself to tidy up after myself, only my son. I can't motivate myself to take my meds, check in with my therapist, or complete my work properly. I am just existing enough to keep my son fed, bathed and clothed, but I am not looking after myself.

I'm seriously considering suicide again.,"I'm getting tired of posting here repeatedly, not because of the sub itself (actually, it helped me go through tough times) but because I have no one else to talk to except internet strangers. The post is long, bear with me. This might be my last post, and I \~\~want to\~\~ have to get some things out of my chest. I am very tired, and haven't been really feeling anything since yesterday, after I got back from Chicago, so it might be a bit messy, and just... not organized at all. But here goes:

I'm so lonely. I want people to like me. But all I am is a waste. A waste of time, resources, and opportunities.

By no means am I the unluckiest person around. I have an above average IQ (152 WISC, 149 WAIS), I have certain traits that I'd like to be proud of, such as being orderly and responsible, speaking 3 languages fluently (EN, ES, KR) and 2 languages in the beginner level (FR and ZH) and know a couple of more alphabets like Cyrillic, Greek and Yiddish, and I absolutely love to learn, read, and to experience. but somehow, even with all that, I managed to be the biggest fucking trainwreck I could possibly imagine. 

My father locked me in dark rooms for hours when I was 3 to 5. I was diagnosed w/ T1D when I was 5. I was always a bit weak, underweight. I started having behavioral problems since 10,  including but not limited to: violent tendencies, compulsive lying, stealing (I don't know if it's kleptomania, I hope it's not. But even if it is, won't make another difference. Just another problem on my list), etc. I was diagnosed with Night Terrors and Bipolar Depression when I was 12, 13 maybe. I have suffered from achluophobia and a mild claustrophobia, as well as some social issues. I won't label my social issues, as I haven't got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the anti-social category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, I'm just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself.

My only friends (3 or 4), whom I've always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship (to be honest, I don't blame them, because I'm fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit). I have a cousin 3 months younger than me, who has a much better and more successful life than me. His father (my mom's younger brother by 1 year) is the current president (33rd) of the Korean-American Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health (he is ""ripped"" as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. I'm 56kg, 170cm), has better looks than me, is a better student (no problems in school) and is just all-around a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around.

My family isn't very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me (I hope) but treats me as if I were some lazy-ass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 5-6 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I don't have much body fat. I excercise semi-regularly (45 mins a day, 3-4 hours a wekk, maybe), I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it (all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet). My grandparents (the ones alive) clearly cares more for my cousins than me, and they don't necessarily hide that. My dad compares me to his former self, and acts like I don't put enough (or any) effort and treats me like a literal pet. People actively avoid me, because my personality is just straight up fucked, and I act so weird, almost pathetic around others, that I'd rather stay at home than humiliate myself in front of others.

My biggest problem and fear is that I'll slowly become my father, because he is the most despicable human being I can think of. He is just such a hypocrite, miserable, self-justifying, rationalizing, condescending piece of shit; but I am so similar to him, whether it be personality, tastes, interests, points of view, etc. Another big fear of mine is that no one will validate my efforts, despite it being my best. But it's already becoming true.

I'm just tired of nobody loving me. I had this one girl that I liked since 5 years ago. We were friends; or so I thought, I've discovered a few months back that she's not just not interested in me, but she absolutely despises me. I trusted her with some deepest feelings that I haven't shared with anyone, and I have a feeling she's making fun of me for it with her friends, as I can feel them being very condescending towards me, and making fun of me or just ignoring me.

I just think that this is unfair. I don't know how to approach people (hell, I've never gotten a kiss in my life, when 90% of the people my age I know already have boyfriends/girlfriends. Although, I want a more serious, emotional kind of relationship, even though I'll never even get into one), I don't know how to get better and meet everyone's expectations (including mine), and I don't know what to do in general. I've felt even more pathetic during my 2 weeks in Chicago, and I don't know anymore if I want to go to the US for college after I graduate this year (if I make it out, I'm going for a neurology-psychiatry double major, and a linguistics minor or certificate).

I have not decided how I want to go yet. I have enough rapid-action Insulin to kill myself in 3-4 hours, a knife (to sever either my jugulars, my carotid artery, femoral artery, or my ulnar artery; I know how much it hurts, I was into self-harm for a year or two, so don't give me that ""it's painful, suicide is not painless"" argument), there's a beach about an hour and a half away on foot, where I could drown after getting tied up. At this point, I'm just tired. And if I'm tired already, I don't know how will I carry on for the next 30-ish years of my short life (shorter than most, anyway). I just want to be loved. I want to be able to have someone genuinely love me. Not in the physical way, but I just want to know that I have someone to be there for me, to be willing to share my burdens, as I'm willing to share hers. But I guess that's a luxury I'll never be able to experience.

Help me. I just want a normal life.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
How can I (32F) stop feeling like such a burden to my husband (36M)?,"I am going through a very difficult time after two miscarriages in the past couple of months and a recurrence of depression and anxiety symptoms. He works about an hour away, while I work from home, although I have very little work, so most of my days are just spent doing...well, nothing. I'm sometimes so depressed I can't keep up with basic chores, which I feel I should be doing since I'm home all day. My husband hasn't confronted me about it directly but I think it annoys him.

&amp;#x200B;

Some days I feel okay. Other days I am irrational, fearful and tearful. I have a huge fear that he will leave me, which I have expressed to him--and which he always denies, but I know it must get annoying that I keep bringing it up, though I can't seem to help myself. I can't imagine how annoying and difficult it must be for him to come home from work and not know if he's coming home to see me on an ""okay day"" or a really bad day.

&amp;#x200B;

Our communication isn't bad, but I've recently felt myself pulling away and trying to rely on my own inner strength, but sometimes that backfires and I do a 180 and turn into an absolute mess with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like he deserves so much better than having basically a half-wife who is so unsteady.

Last Friday, I was given an ultimatum at work.  I am the director of advertising &amp; marketing for one of the largest independent automotive groups in the Southeast United States.  I was told, in so many words, that I had a week to 'prove my worth' or lose my job.  Never mind that I have reduced our spending by 45% since I started, and brought in triple my salary in additional new business due to digital marketing efforts I implemented in the organization, all the while maintaining the original sales output of our business.  I was given exactly zero direction as to how to 'prove my worth'.  Needless to say, the last week has only served to heighten my stress and anxiety.

I've never been a very 'physically affectionate' person.  I get that from my mom, a survivor of sexual abuse when she was a child.  But yesterday, I really needed a hug from my wife.  I just wanted to hold her in my arms, breathe in her scent, and feel like everything was going to be 'alright'.

All this time keeps ticking and going down the drain and I've missed out on so much. I am 25 now and still haven't even learned how to be a teenager or had any teenage friends or teenage life experiences yet, but now I'm too old to even have those experiences and have completely missed out on everything. 

I can't even get therapy because they said I have to have at least 1 hour a week of social interaction for 6 months before they will even consider a rereferral, which is a completely impossible goal. I spend like 12-16 hours a day, begging and begging for people to be in my life, even offering them money, but literally not one person will hang out with me, even once. They all assume somebody else will but nobody does. I don't know what to do. I'm so lost and there's not one person I can ask for help. No family members, no friends, no idea how to get them in the first place. You've got to have people to get people and I'm just stuck in this cycle of isolation. Speaking to people on the internet is like speaking to bots who all copy and paste the same useless things, ""put yourself out there"" ""join a group"" etc etc, I've already done it for years and years and years and and none of it has worked. I don't know what to do.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
What to expect when you share your mental health with your family?,"I recently shared some parts of my mental health with my family. So my question is this: what should I expect them to behave after sharing this with them? My experience telling them wasn't pleasant and I don't know if I'm at fault for sharing or if I'm at fault for expecting a certain behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's what happened:**

I am 24, female. I've had depression, anxiety, dissociation and derealisation for over 2 years now, probably had it before but it was only confirmed by a therapist two years ago because that's when I went to see what's wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody knows about this side of me but my ex girlfriend. So recently I told my mom I have anxiety. My family keeps showing at my house randomly to visit and stay for hours and that would cause panic attacks each time because I wan't expecting their visit or planned for it. So one day I burst and told my mom why I'm always upset when they show up like that. (all I expect is a call before hand to prepare myself mentally).

&amp;#x200B;

I've told them about my dissociation and derealisation because they have been nagging for months wanting me to buy a car and drive instead of commuting and refusing to move to a house that's far from work. (my mom lives with me so me driving is important to take her places) I kept telling them I'm not ready and I just need more practice. (I took so many lessons and wasted over 1500$ learning with no result to the extent I was kicked out of the driving lesson by my instructor because he thought my driving was dangerous) So one day they said I'm a coward and that I should just go and drive and not let my fear control me. So I shared the reason why I can't drive. They first said there's no such thing as what I mentioned and that I shouldn't diagnose myself with no knowledge. I told them I went to 3 therapist and they all confirmed this. After a moment of silence they said I shouldn't let this stop me from driving. I said no It should stop me because it's a danger to my self and the people around me. My sister said ok seek help. I said it could take years to heal some never do beside I can't afford to see therapists at the moment. she sent me a link with affordable therapist to contact.

  
After going home my mom spoke to me about what she heard. She asked why I never shared this with anyone before. I said because you're my family and I rather not let you worry about me. She then asked about it and I told hear some symptoms not to scare her so much. (she's a doctor so I picked my words wisely) she then said that I shouldn't have shared this. I asked why? she said your brother in law heard. I said so what? are you ashamed of me now that I saw therapist once. That my mental health is not golden? That in your society I'm considered crazy now? I never got an answer... 

It's been couple of days now and nothing happened. Nobody talked to me about it. Nobody asked about it. nobody read about it to know what the hell I experience. it's nothing. Like I never shared anything like they just don't want to think about it or even acknowledge it.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it my fault for sharing? is it my fault for expecting at least some interest in knowing what I have? they are my family after all and I feel that's the least I should expect. Is it because what I shared aren't considered as important as depression? (I can never share that with them)

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your thoughts and experiences or advices for how to handle this.

Sorry for the long read but I never share anything with anyone and this is a first for me.

Goal in life: not to feel suicidal,"I'm a pretty solitary person. I rarely talk to anyone on or off this internet. I think I'm happy with this. I've tried the normal life for a couple years and have reverted back to my introverted, solitary ways regardless. I've rarely felt happy or enjoy many things. Most of the time I'm fairly blah. I'm perfectly fine with this and I usually am pretty bored unless I'm working on class work (university engineering student so I am not bored often lol). I find most things boring, even video games most of the time (which I'm sad about bc I loved games growing up). 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this, I'm fine with but one thing. That's feeling like I don't want to live anymore. It happens occasionally when I'm stressed out or extremely frustrated. It's pretty much always bc of all of the schoolwork I have to do or an upcoming exam. My life is completely consumed by schoolwork which would be fine if I were comfortable in it, but I'm constantly behind or don't understand stuff. So that just frustrates me more. The last time I wanted to die was about an hour ago. I was frustrated at having spent my 13th hour (non consecutive) on a homework assignment. I wasted two hours of my life sulking and looking up various ways to kill myself. (Finally found one that doesn't make me scared. It's the one where you put a bag over your head but pass out from innocuous gasses like helium).

&amp;#x200B;

So what are some ways you've found to counteract these random depressions. (I'm a very pessimistic person so when people say enjoy the flowers or life is so awesome, I think that's really dumb in my opinion. That logic doesn't work for me)","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
Help with budding relationship,"Hey all - I am sorry if this isn't what this forum is for. I have depression, but I'm doing OK with it for the moment. My issue at the moment is that a guy I was dating also has depression, and after weeks of basically an excellent budding relationship, he ended it saying his anxiety was too much and didn't want to go further as his mindset wasn't in the right place.  


Honest, but devastating. It's now been a few months, and we have kept in contact, but the communication isn't anything like it was, and although I want to ask him if he is ready to reconnect, I don't want to push him away.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT I also know that with depression, you push people away in an effort to protect yourself, or because you feel like an impostor; You don't deserve the love/attention/etc  


SO. What do I do? If I was giving advice to a friend, I'd say just ask him and say 'If you really aren't interested anymore, I get it, but I want to know if there is a chance of reconnecting and seeing what potential is here' etc - BUT I know that might be triggering or whatnot.

Why can't my friends and family see that I'm not fine?,"So this is hard for me, I really don't know where to start. I've never felt fine, in my 31 years I can't remember actually feeling happy. Sure I smile and pretend I'm ok to everyone I know. I get myself to work each day too, but only because it's a routine. 

Pretty much twelve months ago something happened that triggered me to be bad enough that I couldn't sleep and I was having panic attacks about nothing.  So I finally saw a doctor and she diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and stress... And referred me to see a psychologist but I've had bad experiences with councilors when I was really bad at uni. So I got anxious about it and never went. I didn't want to be judged for what happened either.

I've tried to reach out to my partner, but she has anxiety too. If I lean on her too much she drops her bundle. She tells me she's happy and relentlessly reminds me that she wants to get married and have kids because we're getting older. I've told her that I'm not having kids until I feel better, then I smile once and some how in her mind that makes me better. Otherwise we work really well together, except I never really feel like I feel in love with her. 7 years on I'm still waiting for that spark.

My family is fine, nothing bad ever really happened and we all talk, but it feels like they wouldn't notice if I wasn't around. They are so self obsessed, they call me to whine about the mundane things in there lives but never really ask how I am or if they do don't listen to what I have to say.

I hate my job, sure most people do, but I find it so sole destroying. Feeling so shitty, I find it impossible to apply for others. I feel so trapped.

I don't really have any friends I feel I can trust. At any rate I never let them see the depressed me, just my well practiced smiling facade.

Ultimately I feel so incredibly lonely and isolated. Ive thought about leaving everything behind and taking a trip. Riding to Alaska and back again type thing. I've thought about breaking up, but I only feel like I would be more alone.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either trapped in this terrible no man's land I've created for myself. Reddit can you help me figure my shit out.

Effects of anti depressants,"So I just started anti depressants this last week and I wanted some input from people that are also on them.

!TRIGGER WARNING!

I cried so hard i threw up tonight. TBH it felt good. In a scary way. Due to depression and mental and emotional abuse, a few years ago I was severely malnourished. My hair was falling out. I had growths on the back of my tongue. My nails flaked a part. I stopped eating almost completely. 

I'm now clinically obese. Not excessively so, but jumping from 130 to 230 in 3 months was a fucking wild ride. I dont want to go back to that place. Im gonna talk to my therapist about it in a few days, but I couldn't hold it in anymore. 

I'm scared. Im scared of what I'll do to feel better, to hate myself less. 

I'm also afraid of what I'll do if i don't stop hating myself.

"Had my 1st doctor appointment to address my anxiety/depression, it was......weird. Need some feedback, please.","So I had my first Dr's appointment to address my increasing anxiety and depression yesterday, and found some things a bit...odd. I'd like some feedback on a few things (just need to know whether some of the stuff I'm about to post is common, or not)

&amp;#x200B;

1.) A lot of the stuff was ""up to me"" and I was given questions I had no idea how to prepare for or answer. I went into this with a ""I have no idea what the hell is going on in my head, but it's bad, and I need to address it"" mentality. I have no idea why I'm depressed or anxious so much, only that I did NOT used to be like this.

*-  ""Do you think your Anxiety is caused by your Depression, or your Depression is caused by your Anxiety?""* 

*The answer? I honestly have no idea, I'm coming in with my own mind being a total mystery to me. I didn't know it had to be either one of these.*

*- I was asked what ""kind"" of medication I think I should be on (given a choice between Wellbutrin or another unnamed medication that attacks both Anxiety and Depression together)* 

*- I had no idea how to answer this either, I don't know. When I made this decision I was only 30 minutes into discussing this with a medical professional for the first time in my life, I have absolutely no clue.* 

&amp;#x200B;

2.) After this short 45-minute single appointment with a Psychiatrist, I walked out with prescriptions for Wellbutrin XL and Vistaril. I haven't taken either yet, because I'm not sure that's right for me. I just feel like 45-minutes wasn't even close to enough time for me to ""explain me"" and give enough information that a Doctor could make a decision on the right medication for me. And I **know** that antidepressants and medications of this sort are a total crapshoot, but even given that, I don't feel confident that I'd even be taking a **good** crapshoot from a single 45-minute appointment with a brand new doctor.

*- Is that notion true? Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot? Can't doctors to prior testing to figure out how a particular medication will affect an individual? It just feels odd...coming from a world I'd previous known (getting diagnosed and treated for migranes) where everything was ""testing testing testing! MRI and Cat Scans and Blood tests and this and that!!!"" before being able to figure out something that works for migraines. But now with my mental health it's just ""idk, we'll throw this against the wall and see if it sticks."" Makes me incredibly uncomfortable.* 

&amp;#x200B;

3.) When taking my first steps to address my issues a few weeks ago (and making this appointment with a psychiatrist), I had **absolutely no idea** what kind of doctor I'm supposed to see, what is recommended, or who even ""diagnoses you"" with depression or anxiety. I don't want to self-diagnose, it just doesn't feel right. (After this appointment I still didn't feel like I was ""formally diagnosed"", just given medication).

*So I chose this Psychiatrists office because they had decent reviews of any I could find. I made an appointment before I understood that the ""Psychiatrist"" is the one that mainly focuses on drugs and medication, NOT therapy.*

*- Does ""formal diagnosis"" happen? What kind of doctor does that? Or is that a totally false preconceived notion I have.*

*- What kind of doctor is it most common to see first? A psychologist, CBT, psychiatrist, therapist? I just don't know all the terminology.* 

&amp;#x200B;

The path I've currently chosen: I've not taken my medication (not started), cancelled appointments with this psychiatrist, and gotten an appointment for CBT with a therapist first, which feels like a ""safer"" path for me.  As much as I want to address my issues NOW (I'm impatient), going straight to medication just didnt feel right...

&amp;#x200B;

What is even the point.,"I feel like my depression will never get any better. I can't get out of bed, yet I feel guilty for not working. I've barely eaten - the idea of food makes me feel ill - but I feel bad for not eating. I'm failing my exams and have no long-term goals, because even as an ""adult"" at 19 I don't know what I want to do with my life. I've spent most of the last couple of days staring at the ceiling feeling terrible in every way.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. And my parents don't think that my disorder/disability ([Tourette's syndrome](https://tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/what-is-tourette/#1461071540054-f0944fbc-3f2b)) exists, so I get told off regularly for something I physically cannot control.

Thoughts of wanting to self-harm have come back after a few months of not harming, and I just feel like I want to die.

"Cant get motivated to do anything, even shower","I'm going through my first very difficult breakup after 12 years of marriage to a man who is my best friend and who knows me (and I him) better than anyone, he's been my other half for so long, and he was my first relationship ever. 

I am living with my parents while I try to basically start my life over, on my own, and my depression has almost completely engulfed me.

There are a lot of days where I can hardly motivate myself to get dressed, let alone shower or other basic tasks. I try to go outside and at least take a walk but even motivating myself into doing that is like pulling teeth.

I've been thinking of making a couple lists for me to check off each morning so I can at least get a routine down. I need to find a job and start being productive so I start feeling better about myself and my situation.

Losing all hope,"I've always struggled with depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and body image issues. I've not had an easy go but always tried hard to better myself and get well. I got sober 1.5 years ago, am in therapy, regularly practice yoga and meditation, take antidepressants, get plenty of sleep, eat well, the whole fucking thing. I have a wonderful supportive husband whom I love, and with whom I had looked forward to building a life and having a family. 

And yet my depression still remains. In the last year, I have studied philosophy and spirituality and religion and cosmology and neuroscience and evolution and the more I learn the more I am convinced: there is no benevolent god, the universe is random and absurd, and life is essentially meaningless. There may have been a creator entity, but its far removed from humanity. I recently watched True Detective and the main character says, *""I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, this accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody.""* I agree with this statement entirely and had never heard anyone say it so succinctly. 

I have felt an urge to try and find some meaning in the world and in my life, that maybe I could climb out of the hole of depression someday, in many ways because of my husband. Until now. My husband is leaving me. He just started his dream job a few months ago, and he's suddenly decided he wants that more than me. That he wants to throw his whole life into work, and doesn't want to be married, or have a family, anymore. (Note: He is not leaving because I am depressed - he is leaving because he doesn't think he can be a good husband for me while he does this job, and this job is more important to him than I am.)

This pain...its just not bearable. It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable. I fall to my knees sobbing and begging the universe to give me a sign, ANY sign, that I should keep going, that there is something worth living for, that there is some meaning in this, that the pain will be worth it in the end. But there is no sign coming. 

And I look at the world and the enormity of suffering in other places, where children are slaughtered in wars, where women are beaten and raped, where people shoot up schools and kill kindergartners...I look at the people who COULD NOT get sober, at the people who COULD NOT get well, or the people who never had a chance to, because their life was randomly taken from them in a car crash or from cancer or some other bullshit reason. 

And then I think about the evolution of humankind. I think of all of the millions of creatures that evolved from reptiles to mammals to apes to hominids. At what point did homo sapiens become conscious beings? At one point did we discover sense of ""self""? At what point did ""meaning"" begin to matter to us?  For all of the many millions of beings that lived before that moment - they had no meaning or purpose. And they represent the VAST majority of the history of animals, of life. And that life? Only represents a tiny fraction of the history of this universe. 

**There. Is. No. Meaning.** There is no way to reconcile how some people have the chances and opportunities to grow and to get stronger, while others do not. There is no way to reconcile the fact that our suffering is a blip in comparison to the enormity of the universe and spacetime.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Trying to initiate self care,"22f here, new to this subreddit. Due to depression and lack of budget for healthier foods (i work part time for 7.75 an hour) I've gained more weight than I'm comfortable with. I would like to balance out my poor eating habits (since I'm living off of the cheapest things i can afford- ramen, chef boyardee, you get the picture) with more physical fitness. I have a few medical problems that prevent me from being as active as I'd like. A few years ago i had an accident and broke my spine so i have hardware implanted and a bum hip. Even taking a six hour shift at work leaves me all but unable to walk the next day. I've started taking walks, and since i live in a rough part of an inner city its difficult to be by myself and not have someone harrass me or follow me. I can't afford a gym membership so i was wondering if anyone had tips or suggestions on how i can do more from my home. If it matters I'd like to focus on my stomach and love handles, its just hard because of my back and hip problems to do a bunch of situps and pushups and leg lifts. Does anyone know how to do these to reduce my pain so i can keep going longer for better results? My body image issues are really starting to affect me, and they havent before...

How do I gauge the success of my antidepressant without knowing what the “best case scenario” actually feels like?,"At this moment in time, I am on 60mg prozac a day. I just can’t seem to stop wondering about how to know when I have found the correct prescription. It has been a few months of increasing the dose and I’d like to believe it has been helping me, but I can’t tell if it’s all in my head or if it is just coincidence I have been having one or two good days a week instead of none. 

prozac is the only antidepressant I have been prescribed over the years, and while I am hesitant to try something unfamiliar, the idea that there might be a more effective medication crosses my mind frequently.

I struggle greatly with low energy levels/ motivation/ fatigue and it would suck to know that all of this time I could have been pursuing a prescription that was a better fit. I feel like I have been making decisions blindly simply because I don’t have the experience of another antidepressant to compare the effectiveness.

Help Please - Parents Sent Brother to Pacific Quest,"Hi all, 

My brother (whose currently 10th grade) has been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while, but my parents/I found out about it last year when he consumed an excess of benadryl in hopes to finally be able to get good sleep. From that time, he's started failing classes and has begun heavy marijuana/alcohol use (even being hospitalized for the latter once). For what it's worth, he routinely started talking about how his anxiety started getting better because he didn't care about school anymore and because he started smoking.

My parents are doing all that they can and know how to do to help him out. I just got back from college on spring break, and they broke the news to me about why my brother wasn't here when I got back—he had just flown out to Pacific Quest (PQ) this morning.

(For more info: Pacific Quest website is [https://pacificquest.org/](https://pacificquest.org/)

What one subreddit has to say about PQ: [https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/4rgsa7/pacific\_quest\_experience\_from\_a\_survivor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/4rgsa7/pacific_quest_experience_from_a_survivor/) )

My parents have been consulting multiple doctors/psychiatrists/school admin/idk who else, and they apparently heard about PQ as a highly recommended program. My mom showed me a video, and it seemed suspiciously sugarcoated/idealistic, so I went on a reddit search to find out more.

God damn.

I thought it was just one post bashing PQ, but it seems that there's nearly nothing positive to say about it, other than the fact that it, relative to other similar programs, has a better quality of life (and that seems like it's not saying a lot at all). 

What do I do in terms of my parents, brother, and PQ? I really am terrified for my brother's well being—from reading, it seems that PQ is nothing but regressive for health. Should he stay? Come home asap? Is coming home soon feasible?

More in general as well: what can I do to help my brother out?

Thank you. I genuinely am terrified for him.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Too many losses..so much pain,"So many losses...I'm tired. Hurting. And feel alone.

The past 7-8 months have been hard. I've experienced a lot of losses and they keep coming.
First..I ended a long term relationship in September. We lived in another state; I left and returned to our home state. I left him, our home and my job. Eventually..I lost my car and cat. 
All of that was hard. My ego hurt because he reconnected with a former ex shortly after I departed (within weeks) and they are still together. He still attempts to contact me and in moments of loneliness and weakness I have seen him, despite knowing about his relationship. 
When I returned to my home state I moved in with my sister. She just informed me that her lease is not being renewed and I have to move in two months. My anxiety is thru the roof as I don't know if I'll be able to get the money to move with such short notice. I am working, but its a seasonal position that ends in June. I am looking for permanent work.
Lastly, a close friend died over the weekend. She had cancer; was diagnosed in December. She had been a big support to me over the years. We talked daily when I lived out of state and every day since I returned. When she received her cancer diagnosis, I was a big help to her.
I feel hurt, lonely and alone. My circle of friends has always been small and it continues to get smaller.
Right now I feel like I don't have anyone. 
I'd like to see a therapist, but most don't accept my insurance. Besides that will also expire in May.
I also feel hopeless.
I'm in my 50s so starting all over again feels daunting.
I'd appreciate any words of encouragement.
Thanks

"My friend says she's depressed but doesn't ""seem"" so and it triggers me","Hello, I've struggled with depression (diagnosed) until last year, so I'm pretty familiar with the topic and mental health in general, which is why I suggested my friend, who was having some problems at school and some angry issues, to talk about it with our school counselor. She went there twice and she's now convinced that she has depression, I didn't say anything because I don't want to invalidate her feeling but honestly I don't think so (but again, i'm not the one who should say it). First of all, she told me the counselor didn't mention it, but made her understand it in a subtle way. Also, she doesn't exhibit any signs of depression, she doesn't have a lack of interest in doing things, or a change in appetite.

All of this makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, every time she talks about it with idk what to say because I can't really empathize with her.

I feel like im worthless and alone. Please help,"I posted this on another sub but I couldn’t crosspost. Im just looking for help.

Im 19 almost 20 and i feel like I’ve accomplishment nothing in life at all.

My story is the following. I was born in Mexico to a single mother and brought to the US when i was one year old. My mom got married to this man and every since I have memory this man has treated me terribly. I’ve been told that he treated me well I was a baby but I don’t remember any of it. I used to be beaten almost everyday by this man and its left scars in my mental state. He would beat me for the most absurd things. He beat me because i didn’t all my multiplications, he beat me because I couldn’t hold a chicken while he killed the poor thing, he beat me because I wasn’t strong enough to help him do some mechanic things. He would tell me that I was useless and worthless. This has left a pretty big scar. And the worst thing of all is that mom wouldn’t do anything and i didn’t know why. I thought everyone just hated me. 

I just want someone to tell me that they are proud of me. Im going to college, I have a job, I have a girlfriend that I love, Im paying my rent and bills but even though I do have all of this I still feel worthless and useless. I feel alone and unwanted, hated by everyone. This leaves me to sob alone in the night because I don’t know if even deserve living. This has lead to many attempt suicides.

I just want to know if Im truly worthless and useless. Am i truly hated?

I need ideas....,"I'm about to be 33 years old, have never been able to get a job due to a lack of ability/skills and the fact that I was born with disabilities - the big one being a developmental disability (Spina Bifida). What's more, I have little interest anymore in attempting to GAIN any skills due to unbelievable levels of frustration and depression (I'm also inquiring about this in a ""disability"" sub-reddit).

Anyway, outside of forcing myself to TRY to learn skills that I have absolute interest in whatsoever and am convinced are still far from any sort of guarantee of being able to land me a job, what can I do to stave off intense boredom everyday, repeating the same routine of sitting on my fat, lazy, ""SEVERELY 'work ethic-lacking'"" ass all day doing nothing but watching t.v. - which sucks during the daytime when all it is - is repeats i've seen dozens of times, and surfing the internet (which I've done so much by now that I'm actually ""bored of the internet"" to some degree LOL/SMH/FML). I'm hopeful that when I finally get the call that I can move into an apartment building that is specificaly for low-income ""PwD"", that (in time) I'll either be able to buy my own video game system or a holiday or something will roll around and get somebody to buy me one as a gift. That will at least give me a third thing to do (in addition to perhaps when I live there and my SSDI slightly increases due to the fact that I won't be living with my parents anymore), MAYBE I'll have enough disposable income to also watch movies from time to time?

I know most of you are going to say that I need to volunteer, and while that is a good idea (and was doing that briefly in the past before they got rid of me because they needed to use me more than I could offer), I am currently recovering from a series of 3 surgeries, and am not really at a point where I can feel comfortable leaving the house and volunteering like that - if I could even find something (you'd be surprised how hard it was for me to find something in the first place).

Having said that, I do agree that I need to ""get out of the house"", my big qualms with that are that 1) most of the time I need to ""kill"" is during the day - when most, contributing members of society (who aren't ""drains on the economy"" like I believe myself to be), are at work, *and* I have a **severe** ""lack of interests"". I'm interested in sports and watching t.v. and movies and surfing the internet like I said....and that's about it. I don't read (I find reading to be somewhat difficult and as a result, a ""chore""), I hate listening to music due to my shitty taste in music as all the bands/genres I liked growing up have all died out and my tastes never matured, I can't cook ""to save my life"".....like it's so bad I'm afraid I'm going to seriously hurt myself (burn/set myself on fire, cut a finger off, etc.),

I've got like 3 friends (and a fourth I see once in a blue moon) I ever see on any sort of regular basis (two of which are married), but are often busy with work and married life, they're new house, and are about to have a baby, etc. I wish I had more, but I made only 1 friend in college that I stayed in touch with, and the other two are a HIGH SCHOOL friend and his wife. I guess I just never really learned HOW to make friends and it doesn't help that I've developed crippling social anxiety when it comes to new social situations or environments. It's gotten so bad and I'm so isolated due to my myriad of circumstances, that I have gotten into the habit of (trying to) make online friends via things like Reddit, but that only does but so much for socialization and killing time. It's not like I can spend time with somebody who lives in another state, it's just a ""pen-pal"" type of deal.

She advised not to disclose that I have depression and said that if they ask, tell them I take it for anxiety. Should I say that or just say it's for SAD? Worried being too forthcoming about my depression will = no new job.

I'm an asshole and I don't know how to fix it,"Recently I made a post on AITA (am I the asshole). PLEASE do not go there and tell me things just because you want me to feel better. The sub decided that I'm a major asshole, and that's the fair ruling.

Multiple times I've been called rude, mean, even lacking in empathy. I hate myself for it. I don't want to be like this. I want to be a good person. But I can't because I don't understand how.

I have autism. I see the world much differently than everyone else. I have no idea why people do the things they do, and I don't think I'll ever understand it. They'll tell at me for my behavior and I never understand why what I'm doing is wrong, even when I explain myself.

The AITA post kind of broke the camel's back for me. I posted because I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't being mean, and... well, I was. Bigtime. People were telling me I was an asshole to the bone, ungrateful, manipulative, etc. One person said ""Douche alert!"" with red siren emojis. Another said that I'd lose all of my friends.

I'm a monster and I'm not even aware of it. Even after reading all the replies, I still can't understand why I'm so mean. But I am. Honestly, I'm just considering suicide at this point. I can't function in the world, so why should I even be here? I don't know how to get better. My brain is wired wrong and I'll always think the way I do. Would anything help? Should I just die?

I'm 16 and I'm a mess,"(sorry in advance for bad grammar) 

I don't remember when it started. It was weird, realizing how much I stopped enjoying most things. My favorite video games weren't as exciting anymore. I wasn't as interested in anime and Manga anymore, I didn't feel like consuming it either. My days became boring, each one beginning with the envy of enjoying something that I (used to) love and each of them ending with this overwhelming feeling of regret. I was more angry, I ranted with myself a lot about stupid things, I was crying more, most of the time because of stupid things (albeit that started a chain of thoughts leading to more serious issues and regrets). And mostly, I was so tired man, and it just gets worse and worse. It's to a point where it feels crippling, like I can't do anything anymore that requires a minimum of effort.


I don't understand. Lots of times, I wasn't even sure if I really had something. Maybe I'm just too lazy? Maybe I'm just tired? Is it really depression?
But why? Why would I have these thoughts, when others are having a it so much worse than me? I don't understand.


I feel so overwhelmed by myself. Sometimes I want to confess to someone, to tell them everything I have on my mind, but now I just feel like there is so much that I don't even know where to begin. Nowadays, I can't even make the effort of talking to my friends. I'm scared that I'll lose them. I'm scared I'm not being a good enough friend, I'm scared I'm isolating from them and they will just go, I'm scared that I'm not enjoy their presence enough and I know I will regret just li'e everything else. 
I know I can make them laugh and smile but I feel like I can't even do that properly anymore, like I'm slowly losing this ability, I feel like I'm not as interesting as I used to be, or as I could be, I feel like I'm not as funny, and I feel so much more things that I can't even begin to list. I feel like I'm a shadow of an older self, like my real me died and I am just his shed, slowly crumbling to pieces. My mind feels blank and oversaturated all at once. 


I feel like I'm not even the main character of my life anymore, I'm not even sure if I ever was, I feel like I'm just a background character, I feel like I'm stuck on froze and I can't move an inch. I see all those opportunities of potential happiness go away, slip of my hand, I feel like I'm constantly waisting my time just by being alive, I feel like I'm losing so much time, I feel like I'm watching all the best moments of my life pass me by and I will never get them back. I feel like I can't do anything anymore. I feel like it's out of my reach, like I'll never anyone of importance, like I'll never positively impact people's life like I always dreamed of. 

You know, the internet is a shitty place, not in all of it's aspects, but in a lot of them. When I started using social media outside YouTube, in this case Twitter, I was around 13. I exposed myself to a lot of shit. To a lot of poeple and events I wish I never knew existed, to a lot of disappointments, to a lot of toxicity... Do a lot of you wonder if you're just weak? The internet often gave me that impression. I think I'm weak, I definitely do, but I don't know how much. I don't know if poeple are just agressive pretentious entitled assholes that think their opinions make them somehiw better than everyone or I'm just being too sensitive and i'td just the way poeple state their opinion, I don't know. 

When I was 13, I played so much vidya, sometimes from 8 am to 8 pm non stop. When I discovered that one of my favorite games was hugely hated on the internet, it made me feel miserable, like my taste was inferior, like I was so dumb to like that thing. I spent, no, waisted so much time defending that game online, and it left me with a terrible sour taste in my mouth when playing it afterwards, like the voices of the people criticizing me were echoing in my head, telling me how stupid I was, how wrong I was to like that game. I eventually didn't even finish it. I couldn't play it anymore. 
And it keeps going. It still happens, I still get that hot feeling in my head when someone hates on something I love and I'm passionate about, I feel dumb and I wonder, I wonder if everyone is like me on that regard? Or is there something wrong with me? Is there something wrong with all of us? 
I'm not even clearly sure about the mental illnesses that I have. 

I feel like I made so many mistakes, so many unachieved things, so many failures in my life,that may not seem much, and I'd agree, but mean so much to me, I feel like I have so many flaws, and those thoughts, sometimes, they're so loud, they're like screams. And my throat is so sore that I can't scream louder than them, so I just want to be deaf. Sometimes I just want to end it all. 



I regret so much things I did, so much things I didn't, so much things I said, so much things I couldve said.. 
my mind feels poisoned, to the point where it can physically hurt. I'm slowly heading to become a social failure, with no lover, no friends and no job. My grades are dropping, I don't do any work, sometimes I'm so tired at school that all of my body hurts from it (litteraly, it's a horrible feeling. It's a bit more complex than that too, I can't describe it but I hate it very much. ) everyone keeps mocking me, sometimes for stuff I don't even understand. I'm slowly becoming paranoid of doing anything in public, like I'm always doing something wrong and poeple will laugh at me, it's like I've been put in a game I don't know the rules of. Everyone thinks I'm a drug addict of some sort, even my fucking teachers. Everyone thinks I'm not normal. 

There is so much more I could talk about. My repressed anger, my failed, awkward attempt at love, my feelings of hopelessness, but like I said, there's so much I can't even keep track of it,like my mind is reminding me of all those thoughts one by one. Everyday feels like I'm waking with a new chain that is slowing me down more, with it's own new lock and it's own new key, and I can't even find the key to the first lock yet. 

It's midnight where I live. I have 22 exercises of math that I should've done during the holidays, due for Sunday. I want to do them now so I can have at least 2 days of fun, but I don't feel like it's worth it. I don't feel like anythikg is worth it. 

I know this is a long text and it's very messy, I'm sorry, I'm tired (duh) and in a horrible state whi'e writing this. But I do hope that you would take a bit of your time to read this, I always wanted to talk about this and sharing it with others and I'm finally doing it, so this is very important to me. If you read this fully, I can't stress how much I'm thankful. Really. 

Tl;dr (grossly) :I have a constant crippling feeling of emptiness, distress, guilt, slowness, frustration and sadness governing my life, and I feel like there is no hope for me.

It’s rare for me to sleep without having a dream that feels like at least two days pass, even if it was just a short nap in real time. 

The worst of these, which has repeated itself several times, involves me being trapped in a makeshift prison camp and used as a slave for manual labor. This particular dream spanned a little more than two weeks the first time I experienced it. I remember some of my fellow prisoners and trying to make friends with them, before being beaten and told not to speak to anyone. About I week in, I often start planning an escape attempt. It’s worked twice, but when it fails, the prison guards kill me, and anyone else who tried to escape with me. On the two occasions where I did escape I was the only one to do so. I run home, to find the furniture rearranged and the walls in different places. I beg my roommate for help and he’s confused, saying I’ve been gone less than an hour. I’m pursued by the prison guards, who for whatever reason are Russian and are experts at tracking people down without raising suspicion. I’ve resorted to killing one of them in one of these dreams, and then it turned out he was just a normal person and not actually there to kidnap me. The “normal” police then arrested me and I went through an interrogation where the police concluded I was insane, then dropped me in an asylum.

It legitimately feels like I’m experiencing multiple days or weeks of time in these dreams.  I don’t know what’s going on. My own mind is holding me hostage. I’ve been dealing with depression for about three years now, and it’s gradually gotten worse over time, but the dreams are a relatively new addition to my daily torments and I don’t know how to deal with them.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
Depressed and feel like I can’t tell anyone,Ok so I am quite young to be depressed (I don’t feel like sharing me age so I’ll just say under 13) and because I am so young I feel like I can’t tell or trust anyone when it comes to depression. I can’t even speak to my friends or family about it because I’m scared they either won’t believe me or I’ll bore them. That’s why I decided to go online and ask for help.

I dont want to lose my best friend (long paragraph),"Im depressed and i have been on and off for about 2 years now. I only have 1 friend and she is also depressed (ik i should surround myself with positive people but idk i just dont) We got high a couple months ago and i noticed some cuts on her hand (i was stoned so i couldn’t really process what i saw and basically forgot about it). About 3 hours after when the effects had calmed down, i remembered that i saw the cuts and asked her about it and she denied it at first but she eventually showed them to me and i asked her why she did it and she told me that she doesn’t even know why, she said its stupid and it does nothing for her but she does it anyway. Fast forward to present day, the cuts are now on her wrists (not super deep) she does it with a box cutter and i have basically begged her not too. She has stopped doing it for about a couple weeks now because she has a job and it requires her to wear a t-shirt and she does not want people to notice. I just dont want her to try and take her own life, I try to make her happy whenever im around her but we dont go to the same schools so im not with her all the time. She has about 3 other friends besides me but they are not aware of the situation. We have known eachother for about 3 years now and have been close ever sense (im a guy) we are very comfortable with one and other but we dont Hug or say we love eachother or anything that we think would make us “uncomfortable”. We have both established that we dont want to be anything other then friends because we dont want to lose eachother. I dont know what to do, in this situation, I have never been suicidal (hopefully will never get to that point). I dont want to lose her and i honestly dont know what I’d do if i did, I feel like im not enough to make her happy anymore.

How do you get over feeling unlovable?,"I've always felt just very second place to everyone in my life, but that I can at least rationalize away by saying that they're at least still friends with me at all. But as far as anyone being romantically interested in me, I just feel so completely unlovable in every way. Like my depression keeps people from wanting me. But I'm always someone's rebound. I'm the person who gets hit up after someone got dumped or if they need something quick or they need a distraction. Someone just did that to me and it just destroys my self-esteem every time. I'm not worth putting time or effort into, but I'm worth hitting up for nudes every time someone hits a hitch in their actual relationship. I'm worth a ""Hey wanna hook up?"" But never actually any emotional connection with anyone.

Not sure if this is relevant but... here goes nothing,"I have a problem with asking for help. Especially from teachers and other important adults.

I also have to miss a lot of class for highschool events and such. There is a possibility I will not graduate and that I will lose my scholarships for college.

Meds help - Sertraline,"Please help lol. 

TLDR at the bottom. 

I started taking Citalopram 5 years ago and tried to ween myself off them. When I did that, after I stopped taking them any little thing would make me angry or burst into tears. I was surprised at how much the meds actually effected me. 

So I asked doctor if I can change my meds entirely and went onto Sertraline, 50mg. 

I recently decided I don’t want to be on these meds forever, and asked my Dr how do I stop them? 
He was no help whatsoever and said just half them etc and take it ever other day etc. 

I did that and now I’m off them. But I’ve noticed my moods changed. Any little thing that doesn’t go right, I get really angry and I could burst into tears. 
Seriously all the time. 

Has anyone come off these and experienced what I’m going through? 

Does it stop? Do you start to feel ‘normal’ again?

Need Help / Afraid to get labeled,"The stigma with mental health is strong. I know  I need help, I have overwhelming thoughts of suicide and dispair, have battled eating disorders for a decade, am in a toxic relationship, have social anxieties in crowds and am a survivor of sexual assault. The problem is... I don't want to get labeled by my insurance company with all of these for the rest of my life. I worry that once I seek treatment and am 100% honest the diagnoses list will be long. I am functioning - maintain a promising career, friendships (for the most part when I doing go MIA), and am physically healthy. I'd say 75-80% of the time I'm living a normal healthy life, but that other 20-25% is dark and frankly scary. I found a letter I wrote my best friend a year ago to the day basically an ""in case I die - hopefully it wasn't at my own hands but if it was, this is why"" It was actually written on a good day, where I just thought I have to explain mental illness and how it's impacted me so someone doesn't think my whole life has been a mess when I'm gone. Anyway, I digress, point is I found this letter and it made me realize I'm still in the same situation as a year ago and I need to find help somewhere.

Just need to talk to anyone,"So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I’m gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. I’m typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. 

Me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven’t told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game I’m playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when I’m going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesn’t seem bad but my mom’s stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him.  

I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked what’s wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn’t stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. 

While we got to my house he didn’t even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me what’s wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancé’s surprise. 

I was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn’t my fault. Every-time I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn’t work. Now he has gone to bed and I’m still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. 

I just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I can’t call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, I’m a mess. I feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me.

Why am I so weird,"I’m just so off. I don’t feel right in the head. I feel so dumb all the time. I used to be a smart kid, what the hell happened? 

I can’t even talk to people. What do people even talk about, how do you get started? Even new people at work make friends with each other, but I feel like they all think I’m just weird or perhaps a bitch simply because I’m so awkward and probably say the wrong thing all the time, or maybe I just don’t say anything when I should. 

I’m so clumsy too. Like REALLY clumsy. Constantly spilling things, hurting myself, fumbling especially when I know I’m being watched. 

I don’t know who I am. I feel like I have no personality, so sense of individuality. I find myself trying to mimic others so I can have a personality but it always backfires. If I were to truly be myself I feel like I’d be a 22-year-old 7 year old. Maybe I miss being a kid that much, like I want to go back and fix it. I know I didn’t have an awesome childhood, neither of my parents were people I could look up to. No role models. 

I’m just so bad at life. I don’t know how to be normal, sometimes it feels like there’s no way to fix it and I wanna just leave for good.

Seriously considering checking myself into a hospital...,Has anyone ever checked themselves in before?

Trying to have energy,"I'm on two different meds for my clinical depression but I still only have a small amount of energy that I have to use up at work making sure I am as normal appearing as possible, so when I get home I have no energy left to cook or clean or do anyting really except maybe minimum requiring things. Like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat (like Dry Cereal or a Pop-Tart or something like that you don't have to do anything to) and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure I have underwear and everything for work the next day.

So what ends up happening is laundry and cleaning and everything else builds up for the weekend and then on the weekend I spend most of the time getting the house back to a normal person level of reasonable and maybe cooking one meal and then back to the week and having to ration my energy to make sure I keep a job. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP that I wear every night but I'd still don't get the best sleep. I have some mobility issues due to injury from the Army and also being overweight. I'm working on trying to lose weight as well but one limitation to losing weight is finding, even at work, needing the snack to keep myself alert. 

 So I'm wondering tips on how to get more energy despite my depression so that maybe I can get at least a little more done so that my weekends could be more than just using up that energy to make up for what doesn't get done during the week due to my lack of energy.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
How in the actual heck does one love themselves,"I have a very bad problem in that the only way to love myself is that I receive love from other people (a potential girlfriend). This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself. The only advice I have received so far is    that, ""You should love yourself."" Great, what the heck does that mean? I have received advice like, ""Engage in your hobbies and court yourself."" Well I already have hobbies and I do nice things every once and a while, no effect there. Plus, I don't have much time to engage in hobbies since I am a college student and despite having some money in the bank, I need to make more this summer.

"I don't know if I'm depressed,anxious or something else (I couldnt think of a good title)","I don't really know where to start, so this post will be all over the place, sorry but I just need to get this off my chest

I got out of a two week relationship a while ago, and although it was not seem like much he was one of my best friends and I loved him to the end, but I kept having what I call 'breakdowns' , I tear up,my heart races, I dont want to speak, I distance myself from others, and a couple other things, these were starting to happen more often and I decided that the relationship was putting too much stress on me so I did something that I now regret, breaking up with him

For the next day or two he was moping around school, I felt really bad and guilty but I thought it was the best thing to do at the time. A good thing to mention right now is that my stress and other things (I couldnt sleep, loss of my appetite, etc...) had also stemmed from my home life, but that goes into a whole nother story. On Friday I found out something, that he had already gotten a new girlfriend (we broke up on Monday btw) with a girl who had a crush on him through, and before, we went out. I know it was stupid of me but I was upset, I was glad for him but I couldnt help feeling...betrayed???(very stupid of me I know)

In short he then told people why i broke up with him, and that is when i started to ignore him as it was private. I keep having these breakdowns and I feel that this story is when it really started to affect me, at this moment I have had 3 breakdowns in lessons and 1 at break, along with many at home.

I just want to know if I'm being stupid or if I actually have a problem, sorry about my bad writing skills, I'm writing this as I'm in a breakdown

If you would like I will get into my ""home"" story, it is a big part of this story

I can’t take it anymore,"Hi guys, I feel like I can’t take it anymore.

I’m 15 years old and in grade 11, I go to an all boys catholic school, which predominantly contains white students.

Throughout my whole life my parents have had a extremely bad relationship. When I was born my dad bailed on my mum, brother and me only to come back after she begged him. My dad currently cheats on my Mum and has been doing it as for as long as I’ve been alive. My mum is dyslexic and works very long hours, I generally only see her for about 3 hours a day. My parents hate each other and haven’t spoken to each other in over a year, putting me in between all their bullshit.

Ever since I started highschool I was getting bullied, it started out with name calling and me being him stopped for a while and they about 6 people started hitting me together. I told two of the housemasters at my school and nothing happened. This continued and I had a panic attack at school where I spoke another teacher about the bullying and nothing happened. Last year a large amount of the bullying stopped and my life seemed to get a bit better.

This year two people have been going at me every chance they can. They taken it to the point where they have created instagram accounts of me where they create memes and just mock me (it has been going on for about 3 months, I only found out recently after one of my friends showed me). I can’t fucking take this bullshit in my life anymore. I just want to  fucking end it","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

"I hate who i am, i don't know how to change.","I've been a neet for 2 and a half years, mostly because i'm somewhat socially retarded, not only am i not good at making small talk or generally talking to people in real life, but i also have no interest in doing so with most of the people that are around me for whatever reason, i also use the fact that i have a heart condition that doesn't allow me to make a lot of physical effort to justify the fact that i'm a neet but the truth is that i'm mostly afraid of having to deal with people.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first 18 years of my life my heart condition wasn't that bad (or maybe it was and i was just used to it) i noticed something was wrong when i started working out and my left arm started hurting one thing led to another and now i can't drink coffee or alcohol or work out anymore, the not being able to work out part made me really depressed since working out usually just made any negative feelings i had go away for some reason, and i was determined to lose weight at the time, now i'm overweight have skinny arms and i don't look anything like i wish i would.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not interested in pursuing higher education, i barely passed through high school and i know i'm just not cut out for it even though my iq is 2 whole points above the standard!

&amp;#x200B;

My parents feed my bad habits probably because they feel some guilt for turning out the way i am they used to scold me for being shy and not doing well in school but they also shit talked me for a lot of small things that i don't really want to remember eventually i started confronting them about it and now they don't really know how to handle me so they just kind leave me to do whatever i want, their generation was very different from mine and i don't blame them for not knowing how to deal with the modern problems i have, i kind of wish they'd threaten to kick me out or something

nothing left," 

(for background information: i'm in my mid 20s, and i live at home with my moms and my brother, and i've been dealing with depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder.)

i don't feel like there's any reasons left for me to hang on to life.nothing to look forward to.i don't even know what i'm looking for by posting this.

but, i can't even figure out how to word a paragraph for it.and i'm only good at making lists, so.here's everything i have the mind to allot right now.

* i can't move away because 1) i am financially entangled (split car payments, and rent that the house relies on, etc) and 2) my mom has repeatedly stated she'd go crazy living with just the other 2.
* no one wants to hire me, so i'm stuck at a job that overwhelms me so much it gives me daily anxiety attacks; i cry out of frustration or stress generally once or twice a day. some days are better than others. some days are worse.
* i'm afraid to talk to my (initially caring) managers about it because i feel like, after my previous health problems and missed work, they either don't believe me, or they're tired of me.
* i just came back from 2 weeks of unpaid medical leave because of a kidney stone. i haven't gotten the bill yet, but who knows if i can even pay it?
* i suffer from anorexia nervosa, but i can never seem to get a handle on it; i've relapsed several times over the past 3 years.
* everyone forgets about me. people stop talking to me mid-conversation. sometimes, my family forgets about me entirely, even when they're going out together or getting/making dinner (which is an Everyone thing in our house.) they forget my birthday.
* no one wants to date me--but, i understand it sort of. (i'm quiet, boring, and sad.) people i catch feelings for either reject me outright or just stop talking to me. someone i've known for 8 years (and dated 4 times) suddenly cut contact with me after not talking for months. the person i've been saying 'i love you' to for the past 1.5 years doesn't even want to be in an actual relationship to me. it all just feels like sweet but empty words.
* one mom is on disability, and my older brother doesn't have a job--he just picks up ""gigs"" maybe once a month. my other mom just quit her job on the spot two days ago, and has just been sitting around watching TV. i'm the only one in the house with a stable job. so, i can't quit.
* my health has never been the best, and i'm honestly just waiting to see when it finally tanks. part of me hopes it's terminal.
* i can't even afford a therapist that i desperately (obviously) need. i know i can talk to my friends, but i don't want to burden them when they already have a lot on their plates. no one wants to talk to somebody that's always bringing up negative or heavy topics. i don't want them to leave me too.
* not even online friends talk to me very much. i'm just kind of Here.
* i'm pretty convinced that the only romantic, lasting relationship i'll ever have is with imaginary characters in a dating sim game. now i can barely play anything with a romance plot because i'll just make myself sad.

i almost went through with it on christmas eve.the only reason i didn't was to keep from ruining christmas for my family.sometimes i wish i did it anyway.

tl;dr i feel trapped and alone in everything, and i feel like it's drowning me, and i want to let it.

I have frightening intrusive thoughts,"I (21F) have frequent intrusive thoughts and i'm trying to figure out what the hell is going on. 

(I also posted this in /anxiety but this may be a more relevant spot to discuss until i see my therapist in a couple of days. I mentioned it to my therapist and we've only met 3 times so its not really something we've been able to talk about all that much yet, since i have much more pressing issues relating to my depression and needing to discuss my past. 

My intrusive thoughts are violent. When i get in my head (as we all do), i go through memories or my pretend-scenarios that i also have playing in my head. If its something i'm anxious about or i dont like it, or just dont know what to do, i immediately have a graphic image/thought of me killing or seriously injuring myself. 

These images are usually of me stabbing myself in the heart with a dagger, banging my head against a wall/table to find that a knife was there (cut to me stuck hanging on the wall by my head), me hurling myself off a bridge, my fingernails being ripped off, me in a boat or plane propeller, turning my car immediately on the freeway... This kind of stuff. Some times I'll randomly have one of me being raped.

Specific thoughts i have that trigger this shit is: 

-a conversation i want to have about something serious, but i get angry and can't handle it so i slam my head against a knife

-a memory of a cringey conversation from the past (why did i say that?! *slams head against knife*)

-memory of a bad boyfriend did a bad thing and i handled the situation terribly 

-etc 

I don't know if i'm alone in this, I just want to know, and then if you were able to stop them, then how did you do it? Its really disturbing and scary despite me constantly wishing to actually disappear from the planet already.

I really need some advice to fix my life..,"I want to apologize for my English, everything i learned was from video games,movies,youtube etc.. 

Hi.  My name is Nick and i want to share my story.. i live in a small town in Greece, im 17 years old i live with my mother and i am morbidly obese 150kg 1.72 height (my max weight was 196). 2 years ago i lost my father from obesity he had many difficulties in the last years of his life with obesity, diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, hormonal issues and more.. i had to watch him suffer for a good chunk of my life so did my mother and my 2 older brothers, after losing him my mother lost it she doesn't think properly anymore and that leads to many bad decisions more smoking, pills, gambling and she doesn't take care of her self.. she eats rarely even tho i try to convince her to eat she refuses. My whole life i was overweight and didn't really have that many friends and most of them only wanted to take advantage of me because of money or something else and that lead to many trust issues low self-esteem and loneliness.. growing up i never had anyone to talk to because my brothers did not really care back then and my parents were very busy working.. they tried to replace love and care with money and gifts so i spent a lot of time by myself in our home not going outside but it didn't bother me back then because it felt normal that way and soon i started to have an interest to the internet and computers in general (video games youtube hardware etc etc) and thats where the whole started going downhill.. i didn't have space for a computer back then because i shared my room with my brothers so i started going to internet cafes near me and i would spend all of my money to buy more playtime and prepaid cards for games.. every day i was getting more and more addicted to the internet and that lead to less time outside, less physical activity, more and more weight gain and i started skipping school. My social skills were and still are very poor so talking to people thru social media made it easier for me to communicate with others and make some friends so thats what i did and because of that i found some amazing people that i had lots of fun with and kept me distracted from my real life problems. Some of them were momentary but some i still talk to even till this day. My whole life i had to endure family drama from both sides of the family and i had to solve every single problem i had by myself cause i did not want to bring up more problems to my family so i had to mature pretty early on in my life. 

Fast forward to now i have lost 2 school years because of absences i dont have any REAL friends that i can count on and no one to talk to i spend my whole day in my room with nothing to do, i dont even sit on my computer anymore i just lie on my bed sleeping or thinking,crying. I am working on losing my weight and thankfully that goes pretty well but i still feel like shit and i find no motivation to keep trying or even living. I am very self conscious about my weight and i hate the way i look regardless of the weight, oftentimes i hate myself and i am disgusted/disappointed with what I've become.. every day that passes these feelings get stronger and stronger i don't know what to do.

Now that you know a little bit about me i want to ask for advice because i have no idea what to do or where to start on fixing things..
I feel like i lost interest in everything and i feel like I don't want to live anymore..i feel alone, lost and that no one likes/loves me for who i am and those who do do it out of pity or just do it because i am a family member, i dont have anyone close to me that i can talk to because the only close real friend i had started avoiding me and i don't really blame him for that. I am ready to make a change because i want strength to be able to support the people i love and if i don't make a change i fear that even more negative thoughts will get in my head like self harm or worse. I know i can't make it by myself and that's why im asking for your help any advice would be helpful and VERY appreciated.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
I'm scared and alone,"I just don't know anymore. Most of my friends from last year hate me, the new ones I've made don't know me, and they would hate me if they did, so I only have one person left to go to, my best friend, and I can't talk to them very often anyway (it's a long story). I don't have anyone. My own family, the people I live with, have no idea who I am, and I don't want them to know, because I would be disowned if they did, so I isolate myself in my room all day. It's like everything is against me. I come home and do literally nothing for hours. I just have these terrible thoughts and I don't know what to do with them. I self harmed for a while, but my best friend talked me out of it. It's been hard to live like this. Having nothing, going nowhere, no idea what I want. And to make it all even worse, I just found out I'm gay, so I have to figure out how to hide it from people who I don't want knowing, how to come out, and when. I just want someone to talk to.

Does anyone have advice for how to deal with feeling hollow and disconnected from people?,"So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on what’s been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. 

Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others (particularly women) for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up.

All through the conversation, it didn’t feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. After leaving I felt hollow on the inside. It lasted till about noon this morning. Felt completely worthless and useless.

I was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Finally able to get professional help but.... How do I do it correctly?,"Hi. Sorry that I can’t split this long post into paragraphs, I’m on mobile and it just hasn’t been letting me do it. So, anyways... I’ve been struggling with mental problems that are incredibly similar to common clinical depression symptoms (loss of motivation, emotional numbness, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, anxiety attacks, low self-esteem, and some more we don’t have to bring up) since I was about 10 and continuing since then. Nobody has ever taken me seriously, and I feel worthless constantly, so I’ve just put a bandaid on my problems and tried to ignore them. But it’s gotten to the point where I’m crippling myself to a noticeable degree and I cry for days on end. So I’ve decided to finally seek help. I think I’ve found a therapist that interests me but... What do I do? I mean, I know how to bring up my insurance and payment methods in a professional manner but that’s all I know I can do. Do I bring up my problems before the appointment so that she can be prepared, or do I wait? What’s the formality usually like for these things? And besides all this just to get the ball rolling, is there anything else I need to do that isn’t obvious? I just want to get better so my family isn’t so worried about me but I sincerely don’t know. I feel like this sub could possibly help as I’m sure someone here must be attempting recovery with a professional.

My Heart Feels Like It's Emotionally Bleeding,"Just a quick one because I'm at work currently. On mobile.

I feel like I have an average amount to be proud of, especially considering how far I've come in a short time. I used to be a failure, honestly. I was on medical financial benefits, boyfriend dumped me (not nastily I might add but he was my world), had no desires for my future because I think I honestly believed that I couldn't achieve anything.

Not gonna go into too much detail about my current partner because he's not reeeeeally the subject here. But I will say that he came into my life abruptly as a friend of the person I was staying with, and literally turned my life around. More than anything, I'm thankful to him for showing me that I am strong enough. I have a job through him (he moved from South to North of my country and dropped into a job, a few months later putting the good word in for me and getting me an interview) and has reminded me of what purpose of life means... We have recently reserved a new, gorgeous build in the town we have come to love, and the coming month we will be reserving it. I can finally get a corgi (my favourite dog breed, if the name doesn't give it away haha) and my life has some substance. I will have a house, a dog, a loving partner and lots of friends, as well as a hobby that I love. I can buy games for my Switch and have a generously donated, very decent graphics tablet to draw on.

So... ""Why it be like this""?

I have moodswings. I feel horribly low and numb and then just... Numb, which I recognise at the time is better than low. I get horribly self destructive (I have wished many times as recent as this last month to hurt myself out of frustration, I only don't because I cannot stand breaking my partner's heart), I cry, I feel hopeless. Yes, I have some happiness but I'm so used to feeling numb. Empty.

Why? I want to get off my meds, I want to feel at the very least normal, not nothing and empty. I don't want to constantly worry. I'm diagnosed with general and social anxiety with depressive episodes because of the aforementioned and it never ends. I have a wobbly relationship with alcohol, because it allows me some reprieve from the constant weight of worrying, but I have a tendancy to not be able to stop and get irritable, which is absolutely one of my biggest reasons to feel ashamed. I'm cutting down, I don't consider myself an alcoholic but I feel its lack of presence. I've been known to even go so low as to abuse a strong painkiller I was given from hospital for something unrelated.

I feel lost a lot of the time and it's come to a point where I'd rather talk anonymously to people on the internet than my partner or friends because, for once, I want to be the reliable one, the happy one. The one everyone enjoys... People love my energy when I have my good moments, and honestly... I do too! I want more of it! But fighting your own mind on a constant basis, introverted... Always giving what I feel is 110%, it's draining, so draining... I desperately want to hear ways people cope.

I feel I could write so much more but goddamn, I've been hiding out in the bathroom for probably about 20 mins so I'd better stop.

Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation?," Hey, before depression took over my life I\[23F\] used to be such a happy person - joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isn't a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me - repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression.

At first I thought it's only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldn't enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. That's when I realized that ""bad phase"" was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was ""this is almost acceptable"".

After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me - Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasn't even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation (along with sleeping) and because I knew that's what I'm supposed to do when I get fired but I didn't really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment.

But I feel like **this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete**. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I can't sustain that, like the old-happy-me is visiting sometimes but she doesn't wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now (great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship) I am mostly anxious and scared. I can't be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like ""you'll never go back to what you used to be before depression"", ""depression leaves a scar you'll have to live with your entire life"", ""depression is a part of growing up, you just can't go back"". I am starting to believe these things and it's sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

Placing too much on outside help?,"Hello,

I (20m) am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior (I caused my own problems) and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. (Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again) 

I have been spiraling (more or less) over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. 

The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. 

I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 5/9 (May 9th - USA), but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is “tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it”. 

This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who can’t afford help and have gotten along just fine. It’s your life, and at the end of the day it’s on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying it’s pointless. 

Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniques/routines/activities did you use / partake in?  What helped change your perspectives?

God I can't help it,"I've tried getting help. I've tried, I really have. I've just been so empty, literally and figuratively.

I attempted suicide and I can't get over it,"It happened when I was in Spain for an Erasmus mobility. I had problems with my family and wanted a fresh start abroad. I wasn't feeling too good already. Actually, I just sunk into loneliness very quickly. There was a community of French people in my receiving institution that was cut appart from the rest. I wanted to make friends out of that gheto-like community, but I could'nt get out of it. Within the community I met someone I thought was my friend, but who ended up manipulating me. I was getting so lonely I thought I was going crazy. I was also in love with my roommate and the situation was very ambiguous. He tried to help, but couldn't do anything. I attempted suicide ten days after my birthday. And eversince that moment I have nightmares of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've given up many things within a few months. I dropped my studies. Parted with friends, and even tried to convince my roommate to leave me alone. I told him I was angry he didn't even noticed that I had attempted suicide, that I also had enough of him being indecisive (he had confessed me his love, but he has commitment issues because of bad past experiences), that I gave up on him. I feel horrible today because of these nightmares and because I fear my ex roommate may not love me anymore after what I told him. I hate feeling lovesick and I want it to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I have started a therapy and made resolutions about work and studies for the next year, but I feel perpetualy anxious and sad. How can I get over these horrible feelings ? I still feels like I don't matter.

Loneliness,"Lately, I've been feeling quite lonely. For a long time, I've dreamed of a best friend, the kind that you never let go. The kind that truly cares for you, that you can be yourself around with, do fun and stupid things with, talk about everything under the moon and that you feel a connection to like no other. I have friends. Maybe even a few I would call best friends. We've been friends from childhood. But we barely talk or see each other. I'm talking five times a year or something. I started feeling left out already when we went to high-school and it got a lot worse over time. Now that we've all gone to collage, I feel more distant from them than ever. I have even considered cutting off ties with them. I don't think I know how to build friendships anymore, or trust someone enough to become that best friend. I crave friendship and company.

I'm not the greatest at keeping up with people either, through text mostly but also otherwise. I always feel like the other should initiate the conversation, and I almost always end up waiting days for them to text me back, because I'm too shy to.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Ugly people, how do y'all deal with it?","So I'm pretty ugly tbh, I would rate myself as a 3-4, body wise I have a nice body, starting to lose it though because I haven't worked out in a couple months, but even though I have a nice body, my face is full of acne scars and I'm going bald and I'm not even 25 yet.
Sometimes I don't even want to go outside because I feel like I'm too ugly, but that's honestly only when I'm feeling down.

Honestly, my mom is the only person that shows me any kind of affection, and it makes me just want to be at home all the time, even though I have friends, they are not really people who I can depend on.

"Feeling helpless, stuck, and confused","I don't understand why I'm so depressed all the time, like I just can't cope with what I have to deal with. I'm on multiple medications and I'm trying so hard to get a therapist but where I live you need parental consent, and I'm not in public school because of my disorders so I can't get a school counsellor, and I'm so scared of counselling now because one wrong word, one accidental confession and they'll lock me up in a psych ward again and that was the hardest, most embarrassing, and most traumatic experience I've ever had, that I now have diagnosed PTSD from it. I just don't understand why I'm like this, like I want to be normal and happy and go to school and go out with friends and get a job and a boyfriend and be productive and enjoy life and I try so so so so hard but it's never enough, I never feel any better. I feel like I'm gonna be like this forever. I just want a normal brain, without any mental illnesses and trauma. This is so debilitating I can't even function on a normal level. I'm five steps behind everyone around me. They're graduating and I can't get out of bed to do my schoolwork I get from an alternative school, because eventually I have to hand it in and then take a test in an area of complete strangers for the entire day, doing nothing after the test, and sitting there for the rest of the day because no one can pick me up and I have no way to get home until my mom gets off work, 3 hours after the school is closed. The amount of anxiety that situation gives me makes me sick. I *want* to do it, I want to get my schooling done and graduate but it takes so much to bring me to even have a sliver of confidence to even consider going. Not to mention, my family makes fun of me for it and always makes jokes about ""Well, that's because your sister actually graduated"" ""Not until you graduate"" ""Well it gives *me* anxiety when you don't do your schoolwork"" (Being said by someone who has never experienced even the slightest bit of an anxiety disorder). I've tried to explain why doing basic tasks is so hard for me but it's hard to explain something to someone who will never get it and just label you as lazy. And whenever I try to explain how I feel, I'm ""having a meltdown"" and ""being selfish"" and ""you just need your meds right now"". It just feels as if my feelings and professionally diagnosed mental illnesses are being brushed off and not taken seriously. I've had multiple attempts and for a week or so after an attempt, everyone suddenly cares and supports me but then it quickly wears off, and ""If it was really that bad you would've actually killed yourself"", or ""You need to start making a *real* effort this time"". I have no support systems or people I can talk to and the only reason I haven't succeeded is because I can't leave my dog. I've had her since the day she was born and people call her the dog version of me. We're so insanely close people are shocked by how mentally connected we are, and she gets upset when I'm not with her. We're two halves of a whole and she's saved my life multiple times so i can't just abandon her like that, I love her with all my heart. So I guess what I'm saying is I feel insanely stuck in my situation right now. I'm a minor, no job, no license to be able to transport myself to get a job, no support system, no one to talk to who completely understands, no therapy access. I just feel like a hopeless cause because what could someone even do in this situation? My mom constantly gets mad at me for having anxiety attacks and I feel like I'm just a burden to her, because she's the one who has to pick up my medications, etc. and she is always yelling at me because she has to take the responsibility of having a kid with a mental illness, and she won't do any research on my illnesses or how to manage a kid dealing with them even though I've asked her many many times to. I just feel completely alone and helpless, and no where to go, and I'm always terrified of asking for help or support because I don't want to be a burden to them as well or seem selfish or I'm asking for pity. No one around me seems to actively care and help me live with my illnesses, because I really need some help dealing with this, I can't get through this on my own.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Real Down,"I’ve been feeling really really down lately to the extent where I just don’t want to do anything but curl up in bed or be absolutely alone. Im mentally and emotionally tired. 

I just started a new job doing something I thought I would be happy doing. I had plans, I had a goal. 2 weeks into it and everything seems to be falling apart. I realised I’m utterly unhappy with what I’m doing and the place I’m doing it. I left my previous job (though the work life was simpler there) and rushed into this new job because I was stagnant there; going nowhere in the company and pay.

I’ve never been able to hold a job for long (3 years the most) and I’m always unhappy with the job. I do know there are other jobs out there which I could be better in but never took the risk fearing the low pay (starting from bottom) as I have plenty of commitments. I fear starting afresh


My wife has been the main financial support in the family and she’s doing way better than me. However the saddest thing I found out recently was that she is also very stressed out and unhappy with her job. The only reason why she is staying on is because I am not financially stable.

Will i ever be enough for someone?,"Hello my fellow redditors

I'm new to this sub and I've recently had my heart broken by someone who i thought was the one, but at least she was civil enough to tell me now instead of 3 years down the line.

A bit about me; 

I'm a 23 year old male father of one and  i suffer quite badly with depression and anxiety, prior to these events I've been feeling lost and the occasional thought of suicide or self harm wasn't out of the ordinary, i struggle as it is on a day to day basis I'm currently under the mental health team here in the UK.

I'm reaching out for help from anyone who will listen, this is my last cry for help.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Struggling with health services, would like some advice (23F)","For the first time in years after being the support for my other half who has struggled with anxiety and depression, I find myself on the other side of the fence. 
I have been trying for over a month now to make an appointment with my GP, I have tried calling my local Adult Mental Health Services only to be bluntly told that I have the wrong number (I didn't, I live in the county they are responsible for) and then hung up on. I then tried calling the non-emergency number for health services and was briefly assessed and told to get to the hospital within the hour to meet a liaison for adult mental health. The liaison spoke to me for a while and she was very comforting and listened to me, and then gave me a leaflet and said to keep trying to ring my GP.
I am at the end of my tether - I work very erratic shifts, sometimes early work and sometimes I finish at 2 or 3 AM making it difficult to ring the GP at 8AM to make an appointment. This has been happening for weeks now and I'm getting desperate. 

I just want to get my health sorted so that I can look after my other half. 

Is there anything else I can try or do I continue to try the GP for the next few weeks?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Need advice o how to help my SO who is suffering with depression. Sorry if it's not the right place to put this.,"My SO is suffering with depression and anxiety and is refusing to get help. It's almost like he just doesn't want to. In fact he has said on multiple occasions that he doesn't want to get better. 

It all started when we had a termination for many different health reasons on my part. That was a good 6 months ago now. I went straight back to work afterward and he just didn't. 

All he is doing is burying his head in video games, he doesn't leave the house, doesn't help around the house or anything. We have been trying to get him to see someone and he just flat out refuses. He self medicates as well and I don't think that is helping at all, in fact I think it maybe contributing to the problem. But anytime anyone brings it up he just says that it isn't a problem. 

He did start to take some antidepressants but has decided that he isn't going to take them anymore. I know we cant force him to get help but he needs to do something. 

I have been trying to support him by giving him space and letting him do his own thing, but that just doesn't seem to be working. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I am scared to bring any of this up to him as he just gets very defensive and nasty towards me (just to clarify it's not physical it's just hurtful).

How do I stop fucking myself over?,"Hey guys so I’ve been making some really bad decisions in my life, on purpose. Like not super terrible life ending decisions, but decisions that I know will make me miserable later, namely starting a habit of not eating and making a character that I really don’t want to play because I didn’t want to say no (DnD is a big thing that I love in life and it also kinda tortures me because I’m in a big group, and groups of people were actually a huge part of my trauma). My new character starts tomorrow and it’ll almost definitely make DnD as bad as school is, but I keep telling myself I deserve the pain I’m going to feel and I really hope the pain I cause myself will push me to suicide (real suicide not just chickening out at the last minute).

Death Anxiety,"Hey all. Sorry if this seems unhinged. I’m just gonna try to get it all out.

In the last month and a half, I’ve been having unwanted deep philosophical thoughts on how we perceive time, what the self is, and that we all die eventually. I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 when I first had these thoughts hit me in a big way and I’m 27 now. Zoloft has always helped, but I’ve been bad about my meds for the last year or so so I’m having a relapse, I get this. But the thing is, the stuff I’m worrying about feels so real. These aren’t “I’m bad,” or “no one loves me,” or “I want to hurt other people” thoughts. They’re on a deeper, simpler level. Sometimes I wonder if I’m being treated for depression when I’m actually just seeing the truths of existence clearer than a lot of other people else and that makes me feel hopeless that I’ll ever feel better. Like the system might not be equipped to help me. It makes me so sad.

The problem with my worries is that they’re real worries. I’m mainly concerned with “why do anything at all if we’re just animals who die.” I AM going to die. There probably ISNT a soul. I WILL eventually cease to exist. All the stuff I care about is just electricity and matter and chrmicals in the brain telling me I care about stuff. The “I” isnt even necessarily real, it’s just a collection of smaller parts. I  know that the classic reddit atheist way of getting through this stuff is just saying life is what you make of it, but when really confronted by the seeming truth that the self will disappear when we die, I guess it just rings kind of hollow. Like, yes of course I love my girlfriend and our pets and my parents and my friends, and I love to make art and perform, I want to go to grad school and get married and have kids. And doing that stuff makes me feel great! But lately I’ve just been under this cloud of “none of this has purpose even if you pretend it does.” Like, I’ll feel great doing these things and then I’ll think “that was nice, but I’m going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually.” Ugh. The whole thing makes life feel unreal and dreamlike. 

I’m scared to die. I want to be alive. I want my “self” to be connected to everything. I don’t want to fade away into nothing. I’ve tried spirituality and I will continue to because i think does help (more like a temporary fix though), but it’s based on so many opinions-masking-as-truths that my overactive brain just won’t stop picking it apart and reducing it whenever I try to participate.

I guess I’m sad that I’m stuck right now being a reductionist and a realist, and that my inner self seems to want to do this even though I know I’m much happier when I’m blissfully ignoring these kinds of questions. Now I get the sense that if I ever want out of this, I’ll have to think my way out but every time I try it seems to make it worse. I dig myself deeper into this pit by engaging with it.

I can feel myself enjoying music, art, video games, podcasts, books and movies less. They all feel like distractions, which I guess everyone kinda knows they are, but it just feels really clear and I wish it wasn’t.

If any of this sounds like you, and you’ve gotten past it, please let me know.

(Note: I switched up my meds and they do seem to be helping with stuff like anxiety attacks and suicidal ideation but the depression feels deeper than just a chemical imbalance)","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

"Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone.","Hopefully this all makes sense, confused and tired right now, and I'm going to not go through and re-read anything like I usually do as I know I would probably just end up deleting this post, so hopefully this isn't too confusing. It'll also be long probably, sorry for the long read, but I need to at least get down all of what happened. Just need some advice/support, or whatever please, I'm not really sure what I need, like I said, I'm not in the best state of mind currently.

&amp;#x200B;

I've skipped school maybe 5-6 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I don't even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. I've never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brothers/sister wouldn't be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe (in a weird way, I know) that I could kill myself if I needed to. I haven't skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, there's a ""time limit"" of sorts on when I'm actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I ""have"" to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, I'm not sure why. Today I woke up at 6:30, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that he'd better walk to school ahead of me if he didn't want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do. Then after that I just went to my bed, and started researching for maybe 3-4 hours, methods, what to expect, etc. etc., all these things that I had been too scared to look up before. Found out the way I wanted to go, was literally about to go find the things I needed, but was so scared that I wanted to delay it somehow, even though I was still determined to go through with it. I told myself that I would set a timer for 30 minutes to sleep, and after that if I still wanted to kill myself, I'd do it after that. Well when I woke up, I felt a little different, a little more hopeful, I'm honestly not sure why, just hopeful enough to not kill myself today at least. Now I have to figure out what to do next. I had a math test today, an ap macro final, a small spanish presentation, and an anatomy quiz. It just seems so so so overwhelming, like I can't deal with it and I don't even know where to start, or what to say to the teachers, or if I can still take them, or what I tell my dad when the school calls today to tell him I wasn't there, or what to do about trying to manage this so I don't end up going through with my plan tomorrow, or the day after that, or next week.

I really, really, appreciate any help at all. Feeling really lost right now. Sorry for the long post.

Losing a Dream,"I have always struggled with depression. I have constant feelings of not being good enough. Lack of self confidence. Life has been a rough road but it's made me who I am. Recently I thought I found my soulmate. She made me feel a feeling I never felt in my life. She gave me so much needed self confidence and I gave it to her as well. Life was on the up. Things were complicated with current relationships but we knew it was going to be tough and I was willing to give her the world and totally shake mine up for it. At some point something changed. Extreme feelings of happiness to guilt, settling, lack of confidence in the situation and shutting it out. Now I am left feeling not good enough. I knew in the back of my mind I wasn't going to be but was always told otherwise. It felt like the most amazing dream. It was shattered. I don't know why but now I am left feeling a shell of what was being built up. I feel used and betrayed. It has been extremely hard to open up about the situation. I am very private and so is she.

My girlfriend has depression,"So my girlfriend of 2 years has told me she’s been struggling with depression. She has times where she wants nothing to do with me and she won’t do hardly anything to take care of her self. I haven’t ever had this struggle so I don’t know how it feels and can’t really relate but I want to help her. She won’t go to a doctor for it and I’m trying everything to help her. She loves getting letters so I have written her one that helped but I don’t know where to go from here.

Not sure what my passion is and feeling lost,"I'm posting this here because I've been in and out of depression most of my life. I feel like I'm slowly getting out of the ""hole"" but I'm confused in that I don't know where to go from here. People say to find your passion, or do what you love, but thinking about what my passion could be makes me feel even more lost. 

I've always been a jack of all trades type of person, and I enjoy a little bit of everything. But nothing comes to mind when I'm asked what I like to do, or what my ambitions are. I guess I'm overwhelmed with the thought because I feel like I want to do everything. I have no idea where to start, and I don't have any energy or motivation to get started.

Does anyone else feel this way? Can someone recommend how to choose a path and find motivation to follow it?

"I followed the plan, and everything sucks.","So, I was a good kid, got good grades, went to uni, graduated with a good degree, met a good man, married, and had kids.  I fell out of love with my chosen career, and so bounced from job to job before my husband and I decided I would stay at home with the kids.

Since then, we’ve moved far away from our friends and family - for husband’s work, and I do like living here - but I have lost almost all my friends, and since my parents died, no one in my family really talks to me any more.  My kids were never much involved in any school activities, so I never made friends with other moms.  Our neighbors never seem to leave their homes.

When my youngest graduated, I decided I wanted to go back to work.  My health threw me a roadblock or two, so I didn’t really start looking until February.  I reworked my CV/resume, and began applying.  Nothing.

A few years ago, my husband started what might be called a mid-life crisis.  He wants to open our marriage, and while we tabled these discussions because of things we’re dealing with, including financial struggles, he has started bringing it up again.

So, I basically don’t have a family, have very few friends, my health isn’t great, I don’t have the money to fix/replace/buy things that are needed, can’t get a call - let alone an interview - for a job, and my husband - who has been my rock up until now - is angry and resentful because I don’t want to talk about opening our marriage right now.

I followed the plan, and now I hate my life.  Getting a job would help so much, but my degree is old and my experience is old, and no one wants me.  I feel useless and awful.  These are office jobs; husband and I agreed other jobs would not work because of health issues mostly, lower pay secondly.

I have no one to talk to - friends aren’t that close; family dead or won’t talk to me; can’t afford therapy - so I am venting here.

Anti-Depressants effect on sex?,"Hey I've only just recently lost my virginity and Ive been on anti depressanta for a few months. I heard they could make it harder to cum and that has been the case even with masturbation. It took longer to finish after I started the treatment. Well when I lost my virginity this week I just dint finish, as Ive had two sessions of 40+min and cant finish. It dosent go soft or anything, I care about my partner and she is trying to fulfill my needs in bed so its not that. Also the sensation is dulled, Ive heard sex is supposed to feel amaizing but I felt little to nothing in the way of pleasure at first. The second time I had been off anti depressants for a day and did feel some more pleasure but It was dulled.

When I mean pleasure I think its more accurate to say stimulation. Im 20, M if that helps my partner is Female its that helps too.

Advice to an 18 y/o depressed closeted bisexual dude who mostly has anti-lgbt religious family &amp; friends and is contemplating suicide?,"(this post got no replies in the depression subreddit so here I go)

I'm an 18 y/o dude. I'm starting my first year of college this August. I've been thinking about coming out as bi to a few friends that I care about and ones I hold dear, but I'm afraid of what might happen if I do it.

We're all Christians (my family's Catholic). I know a lot of people I care about won't approve of me when/if I come out.

I project myself as this ""straight"" guy who's ""just an ally/supporter"" for LGBTQ rights. I've fought with some religious friends as I defended the topic of same-sex civil unions online &amp; offline.

It's been about 10 months since I last went to a Sunday church service where I used to talk to some friends who go to church there. I still go to my neighborhood Catholic church because of my dad who put me in the choir along with my brother. My dad's also the president of our Catholic church choir. He's also VERY outspoken about being anti-LGBTQ. 

I find it hard to come out to my family because we're super religious Catholics. There was a time when my Born Again Christian cousin (female) came out, they recommended her to go to ""conversion therapy"". I was one of the few family members who know this along with my older other cousin and some of my uncles/aunts.

I won't be coming out to my family. Maybe not yet. Or maybe not ever, considering the factors I've just mentioned. My dad and I would probably fight if my family finds out. It's ironic that it's hard to be open to your own family whom you share the same house with. 

Still haven't catch up with a friend/church leader from church/school. I feel bad for ghosting/avoiding friends from this church I used to go to (Born Again Christian). The last time I went to that church was July 2018. There's this one friend, let's call him ""Matthew*"", who used to be my youth group leader and is also a fan of RuPaul's Drag Race and Queer Eye. We both went to the same school (same grade but different strands) in Senior High. However, I'm not so sure if he'd react positively if I openly accept my bisexuality since the church he serves in has made anti-lgbt preachings. When we graduated Senior High School on April last month, I messaged him &amp; promised we'd catch up with each other about life since we haven't talked/seen each other at church for a long time, but we still haven't done it and still haven't talked to each other ever since.

Maybe I might come out as bi to a few close friends soon, or maybe not. I've noticed my teacher from 11th grade seems to be an ally and I even consider him a great close friend, so he's definitely one of the first people I'll come out to (IF I decide to do it).

I think to myself that some things are better left unsaid, but these unsaid words are killing me, and they've been building up in my head for a long time.

It's hard to be yourself when you're not what most people want/expect you to be.

I've been thinking about leaving this Earth, maybe write individual notes to each of my friends/family before I go. The only reasons why I still haven't pursued this is because I don't want to hurt my family &amp; friends, and I'm afraid of dying without fulfillment (for now, at least).

And even if I come out to a few friends, what if the word comes out and it got spread to some people until it might reach my family/friends and they avoid me? It's just hard to wrap my head around.

There's always those things &amp; thoughts bringing me down. I consider myself an agnostic now. I just want to be accepted but I fear the people/family/friends around me won't take it well. I don't know anymore.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Pl help.I am very emotionally fragile. I hate who I am right now.,"umm..this  is my first post on reddit and I haven't been a stable emotional state  for quite sometime now. so...coming to the details,

I\[18/F\]  am having a lot of insecurities, self esteem and confidence issues and I  guess all this started during high school, when I was at the bottom of  the class and i began to feel inferior to my peers and no matter how  hard I tried I still couldn't catch up(I was a straight A student before  high school). and then came college. well, college isn't that bad. I  have always been a very emotional person and I experience a lot of mood  swings. So lately i have been quite down and stressed as I am very  anxious about my career(still clueless). and as a result I haven't been  able to control my emotions. It feels like I'm walking on thin ice and  anyone,literally anyone, can make a small remark and *\*shatter\**  and I'm back to drowning in a cold sea of emotions.I spend a lot of  time crying. I just have no control over it. I want to stop crying, i  tell my self to stop crying and i can't and its so goddamn frustrating.  It makes me feel weak(I am already physically weak and underweight). I  know expressing emotions and letting it out is healthy, but what if you  are feeling so emotionally saturated with all the self hate and worries  that you'd cry to anything. I at least wish i had enough control so i  wouldn't cry in front of someone who is not close. but nope. I have zero  control.

let me quote this one incident.  a few days ago, I snapped at my elder brother when he was pressuring me  to do learn things for my career. He kept forcing his point and it made  me feel small and incompetent and like he doesn't trust my decisions on  what I wanted to learn so I began to get all defensive and I very  rudely told him off and avoided him ever since. I spent a lot of time  crying and affected by it. And just when I had slowly recovered from it,  a family member on hearing what exactly happened made a remark that ""I  think he's better than you, for the family"" which means that I am too  impulsive and rude and emotional and is bound to create problems in a  family.I still haven't recovered from that. I didn't want to cry,  because my uncle and I don't exactly see eye to eye and I wanted to  disregard this remark and get going with my day. BUT i began to tear up  the next second. I cried for hours.

I  hated myself. Do i wish to be rude? no. Am I this emotional by choice?  no. Do feel crying is the solution to all my problems? no. And my family  thinks otherwise for all the above questions

I  want to seek professional help. Having been wanting to for three years  now. But here's the thing. I am from India. I am still in college. I  live with my family and they provide for me.

I have a problem with getting mental help.,"My parents are a bit off.

If their friend or a family member needs help, they will put their entire life on hold. But if their kids need help, it’s rarely done.

I’ve tried for months to get them to make a few doctors appointments. Specifically my psychiatrist. But no matter how many times I ask, it never gets done. In fact, about six months ago, I went to the dentist to get some cavities filled. I had cavities on the top and bottom sets, so, they said that we would have to come to two separate appointments to properly get them filled. Well, we went for the top set, and I’ve asked my parents to schedule the second appointment ever since.

However, my main concern is going to a psychiatrist. Mainly because for about two and a half years now, I’ve had problems with the way my brain functions, and my grasp on reality. I just haven’t felt right. But in that time, I never considered going to a psychiatrist because i had been to one before, and they did prescribe me medication, so I thought that if there was something wrong, they would have found it years prior. But i spoke with some friends about it and they told me it would be smart to go back. 

That was a few months ago and I haven’t been able to convince my parents that I should go back.

It’s not a financial issue, my insurance covers everything

And it’s not a time issue, neither of my parents are working.

My parents are the “There ain’t nothing you can’t fix yourself” type, and don’t understand much about mental help.

It’s getting so bad that my mother won’t hardly talk to anyone because she’s either too lazy, to too buried in some kind of device to do anything.

Then, when I ask my aunt or grandparents for help, my parents get pissed and complain about how I make them look bad.

Don’t get it wrong though, they are great in most other regards, but when it comes to me actually needing help, they really don’t do much. When it comes to real responsibilities, they are just all around lazy. If anything can’t be solved within a minute or two, they won’t hardly even look in its direction.

I’m near graduating, so it’s not like I’m just some middle schooler looking for attention. I’m actually a bit concerned about my mental help, and some of the people I’ve talked to as well, but at this point, I just don’t know how to get that help.

Any advice?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Someone else in my skin would be happy, I've no right to be depressed and sinking into alcoholism, yet here I am","I'm a mid 20s male, college graduate, living in a big city, have a great job. Yet I think about suicide every day. But I feel like I don't have a right to. Other people don't have a lot of the things I have. I'm objectively very lucky and have everything I could want to be happy. So why is life so hard?

I've started drinking almost every day. I'll go to the bar alone and drink. I'll drink until I get sleepy. Then I go home, and sleep. The next morning I wake up, go to the gym, and go to work. Then after work I hit the bar again. Alone.

I'm just so lonely. Why don't people like me. I try not to be an asshole. I really do. I don't think I'm an asshole? But I think people are uncomfortable around me. I think I sour their moods. I try not to be negative though. I try really hard.

I feel my youth wasting away. I feel the passage of time very heavily. These are supposed to be some great years. Maybe even the best yesrs. Single, big city, acceptably good looking. College certainly wasn't the best years for me. So maybe this is when my life is ""supposed to"" peak?

But I have no friends. I have no one to hang out with. I don't have a girlfriend. I have no one I connect with deeply.

I've tried cognitive behavioral therapy. But as soon as I stopped going (feeling like I was fixed) the problems began again. I've been medicated for depression consistently for years now. I've even added exercise to my routine at the behest of my doctor. Improved my diet. Stopped smoking weed. I feel like I've done everything.

What can I do now? I feel trapped. I wish I would just die. Life has been very kind to me, and my stupid ass can't take advantage of it. Someone with a better personality or someone more capable would have a very happy life in my skin.

I think of killing myself every day. I won't do it. But the thought, that's not normal right?

"My self care plan, and I'd appreciate some further advice.","Hello everyone,

I'm a 26 year old woman and I suffer from depression. I'm in therapy and on antidepressants. I attempted suicide in April 2018 but, since then, I've made a lot of progress and I'm quite happy with myself. But loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. Tomorrow I'll leave for another city because I have to participate in a public competition for a workplace (I'm in Italy so, in order to work for the Government, you have to participate to public selections). 

Problem: I don't know anyone in this city so I'll be alone for seven days. Yes, I'll meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day I'll return to my hotel room and I'll be alone. And I'm very scared. 

This is my self care plan, that I organized with my therapist:

\- focusing on the public selection;

\- bringing my favourite books;

\- Netflix for the nights;

\- going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food

\- visiting the city in my spare time 

\- calling my SO and/or friends if I really feel overwhelmed 

Do you have any other advice? I'm a bit anxious.

Lonley and my own fault,"So I recently been in a very bad time noticing that my friends actually are very toxic when we have a fight they tend to hurt me on purpose with things I told them. or well forget to invite me to stuff etc. so I cutted some of them off and trying to reconnect to people that showed interest in me.
But I pushed them away because i habe major trust issues because if my past.
But they don't seem to be that interested which I can understand but it still hurt.

And I do found a nice group of two peps to chill but of course they aren't always available and even if I'm hanging out with them I tend to feel lonley thinking about my past and stuff, not always tho it mostly happens when I see other friend hanging around questioning why they didn't invite me.
Or why other ""friends"" don't look out for me.
I know everyone has a life and is busy but why can't I be a part of it.
I mostly think it's my fault (but I don't think always like that).

At risk of losing the only thing I have left... Please help :( Sorry it's a long one,"I lost my job. I am being evicted. I have a 5 year old living with me and an 11 year old who doesn't. And my boyfriend is now saying he wants to move back home to Norway... 

I have no idea what to do, I'm a complete mess and feel like my life is at a cross roads. One leads to potentially hurting my daughters, one leads to a literal dead end for me... which will hurt them more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of a background:   


I'm 31, been abused my entire life, by parents, by siblings, by random strangers and ex partners. I've been in abusive relationships, mentally and emotionally abused, sexually abused at least 5 or 6 times... I've been raped. 

I lost custody of my eldest daughter because her father kidnapped her after I tried seeking help for her anger issues. He refused to bring her home after a visit and the Social Services let him get away with it. 

My youngest daughter was 8 months old when her father had a heart attack (aged 28) on our sofa while I put her to bed. He died instantly. I moved cities and my mother disowned me, so did my brother and my grandparents. I have nobody. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up in a string of very abusive relationships, got engaged to a man who left me no choice... All the while, I was talking about all of this with my best friend. He was so supportive, so wonderful... I was going to move to the US (again, coerced and manipulated into it) but I had to meet my best friend first, as it was our one and only chance of meeting in person. So I flew over to Norway to be with him and hang out for 3 days. Nothing happened. Nothing at all... but it was obvious we both wanted it to. 

He gave me the strength to leave my abusive fiance (Who by this point had sent death threats and abusive messages to said best friend and all my other friends, threatened to kill himself and his 3 year old daughter if I didn't move over there.) I became a target for abuse from his family after we split up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today- My best friend and I have been a couple for just over a year. Things have been amazing until he moved here.. We both got a job in the same place, and I became massively stressed and depressed. The stress of everything changing hit me hard and I admit I stopped showing him any affection. I hate myself for it, we argued ALL the time. 

We lost our jobs due to some REAL shady stuff going on at work (tax evasion, illegal activity etc) and he told me he was moving back but not leaving me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I am now. I've been back to my normal self the last few days, feeling more love for him than I ever have, wanting to show him... But I have just under 2 months to vacate our house. With little to no money in the bank and a daughter to look after. It's her birthday and we'd planned a huge party ... 8 days before we're due to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

If he leaves and I'm on my own again, it \*WILL\* kill me. I can't lose this connection with him. I can't be on my own again. I can't stand the thought of not having him beside me every day, of spending the next gosh knows however many years only seeing him a few times a year, or only over Skype... 

&amp;#x200B;

But if I move to Norway with him... My girls would be 1000 miles apart instead of 200... My youngest daughter won't see her grandparents as often. She's already lost so much as well... She'll not know the language, she'll not have her friends... 

I'm torn... and I'm a mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I hurt my daughter in the short term... or do I just let myself die and be freed from this eternal struggle for good? I'm fed up of fighting. I'm fed up of everything always going wrong. I WANT to run away and I know that if it was just me, I'd go. I'd drop everything except the essentials and just be with him in Norway and never look back. 

But I have to think of my kids, right? 

I feel it's make or break time... for all of us... My heart says to just go. But my logical side is unsure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I a sociopath...?,"This is a throwaway account.

So, I have been struggling with depression for quite some time now, and I am very very concerned that I may be beginning to show sociopathic tendencies. 

I have a friend, who, for anonymities sake, shall remain nameless. He is my best friend, and has been for a long time. But lately, I have noticed that I feel almost like I want to know everything he does and when he does it, and he is part of a group that I recently left, and is, in fact,in a leadership position there. 
I left for several accumulative reasons, but one of them was because since he was in a leadership position, we where not able to converse at the group. It was hard for both of us, but we tried to follow the rules. 
After I left, I started having trouble with the nights that the meetings where taking place, like it was hard for me to accept the he was still there and I wasn't. 

I'm also noticing that when we have something planned and he backs out because of, for example, work, I find that I am way more bothered by that than I should be. 

So, am I a sociopath, and what can I do to stop these tendencies?

"Anyone here have reverse seasonal affective disorder - i.e.: summer depression? If so, could use some advice","For the past two summers like clock work around the last week in July I have been hit with the above - I don’t know what else it is other than reverse SAD. It usually starts with a general few months of feeling good and stable - meaning I’m feeling normal, motivated and generally happy with some dips that I’m used to for the most part.
The past two summers I will have a really good day/week/ whatever and then one morning I’ll wake up and feel “hungover” or “in a fog” even though I haven’t done anything to bring this on (like drinking, using substances). Also, I’m quite active physically - so that’s also strange. 

What’s even more frustrating are the physical symptoms- my legs feel like noodles and I feel like I cannot “wake up” despite caffeine and Adderall.

Two summers ago it hit me at a physical therapy appointment- literally felt so incredibly off that I had to sit down for a minute. The PT said “maybe it was “menopause”. Wanted to throttle him, lol.

In a span of 24 hours I went from a normal mood to really off. It progressed to the point where I spent most of August in bed - only getting up to use the washroom and do basic things. I vividly recall literally crawling to clean the cat box my body felt so heavy. I actually felt paralyzed. I also recall having to return and item I borrowed from a friend and having to drive and being so out of it I wasn’t sure I could. It felt as if I was wading through deep water or mud.

Last summer I wasn’t expecting it Bc I thought the summer before was “just a fluke” or “hormones” but I vividly recall the day before I was very productive- did a lot around the house and generally felt “up”.  The next day when I got out of bed, my legs were like noodles going down the stairs and I felt “off”.
I was sitting drinking coffee when my husband looked at me and asked if I was ok. I thought I was just tired, but as the days progressed I got worse and worse.
It took me months to recover Bc I couldn’t find any type of add on medication that I could tolerate that helped.

During these spells I literally feel as if I’m drugged - I am searching for words, I have no energy. I feel as if I’m literally impaired or like I have taken a sedative.

I understand it must sound dramatic, but I’ve not been able to find anything (medication wise) that is able to help.

I had a gene site test and I’ve tried the meds listed in my “green bucket” and the side effects were so intense I couldn’t continue on them, not to mention they’re not covered by our insurance- so we paid over $1500.00 last summer on meds that didn’t work.

I find it difficult to find other people who have this and especially difficult to convey to my prescribing Dr. what I’m going through. 

Additionally, I don’t understand why it just happened so recently and without much warning- like “cause and effect”. I have had depression most of my adult life and have been able to manage it with medication and lifestyle changes, but this summer thing is a different animal.

Now it’s June and I’m hoping that I can do some prevention as I feel like I’ve exhausted meds. options. 

I have an appointment with my provider this week and I need to be as pro active as I can now in case I have this experience again. I just don’t know what to ask for at this point, nor what to even do - or if I even have to do anything. Maybe it won’t happen - I mean anything is possible, but I feel like I need to at least try to be prepared.

Anyone have experience with this and any tips?
I am thinking of preparing myself for a ketamine infusion or something this year.  I just cannot imagine going through it again Bc it lasted so long this past summer -well into the fall and I got to the point of being so low it was scary.

A Dr I see occasionally suggested planning a vacation during the time when I usually feel this come on - sounds good, but also - could be a train wreck.
Anyway - anything would be helpful.

Backsliding into my depression,"This is my first post here and I definitely need some help right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have diagnosed PTSD and depression and graduated off of anti-depressants in December. It had been a steady rise out of depression since then but these last two weeks have been a quick backslide into my depression. I feel like I'm losing autonomy of my mood and it's making everything impossible again. I can't focus on work or my relationship. I'm having intense suicidal thoughts again and having horrible nightmares. I lost my ability to take good care of myself. 

I know about the backslide but I didn't realize it could come on so quickly. I feel like I'm losing so badly and I need some help. I can't afford therapy anymore and I can't see my therapist so I feel completely stuck. Does anyone else have any experience with this? I'm trying to focus on my work but I can't. I can't even enjoy things I used to love. I can feel the heaviness setting in.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Need help figuring out alternative reasons why I'm experiencing excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation but stable mood","Intro:
I'm primarily looking for anyone that has had a similar experience as stated in the title. I'm going to try and keep this as pithy as possible for convenience but there's just so much. I will try to keep up with comments to discuss or answer questions before my Dr appt tomorrow. Thank you for taking time to read and for any advice given. Gotta be careful bc Google is a black hole, y'all. 

Renunciation:
I want to elaborate what I mean by ""alternative reasons"". I'm looking for other possible medical issues other than Depression. I know I have Depression, that's not the issue at hand. If you must suggest that it's Depression, please be constructive and give me something specific to work with. 

Background (Major Depression, A.D.D. and bipolar II):
 
- Diagnosed with Major Depression 8 years ago. 
    * been going to the psych Dr, taking medication, and going to therapy since then. I've been meditating occasionally for 5 years. 
    * I have yet to find a medication or combination of medications that is effective for me for more than 6-12 months. 

- Diagnosed with A.D.D. back in grade school
    * took Adderall for a couple years but stopped
    * started taking it again in college 11 years ago and mostly consistently since then. 
    * within the past 4 years, I cannot stay awake the whole day without Adderall/Vyvanse/Focalin.

- No official bipolar II diagnosis but Dr's have brought it up 
    * Almost all of the mood stabilizers and antipsychotics I tried did NOT help me and made me so much worse
    * I really don't feel I've ever been hypomanic as even my best moods are like a regular person would be. 

More recently:
- Started taking 50 mg Zoloft (sertraline) while  weening off of Viibryd (vilazodone) in mid-April.

- Have been taking lamictal (lamotrigine) almost as long as I've taking medication for depression
    * I've been wanting to get off of it for years but I either haven't been consistently stable enough or it was not a good time due to school or work
    * finally started tapering off today

To the point:
Throughout the past month, aforementioned symptoms have been worsening (excessive sleep, extreme tiredness, low energy, no motivation). No matter the amount of sleep I get (4hrs, 6hrs, 8hrs, 10hrs, 20hrs) I feel overwhelmingly exhausted when I wake up. Any energy or motivation I have seems erratic and is dwindling. Motivation is very up-and-down but progressively more down. 

My depression has always been heavily tied to excessive sleep and lethargy. These symptoms are definitely nothing new to me, HOWEVER, it's always been accompanied by very low moods. At this time my mood is decently stable and that's the baffling pay. I wouldn't say I'm the happiest I've ever been but I'm stable. 

Instinctively I assumed it was a med problem since my symptoms are indicative but my Dr isn't entirely convinced that's the case since my mood is stable. She didn't up my Zoloft but we finally decided to taper off lamotrigine. 

She doesn't really know what's causing the excessive sleep and exhaustion. She mentioned that it's possible the Vyvanse is negatively contributing even though it's pretty much the only reason I can stay awake all day. She suggested there might be something else medically wrong.  As luck would have it, I see my primary Dr tomorrow for my yearly exam so she told me to bring it up. 

I've had my thyroid tested twice, the last time was a year ago and that checked out fine both times. I don't recall getting treated for anemia ever so maybe it's that? Any other ideas? I'd like to get a better idea before I go to the Dr. 

I brought up the possibility of doing a sleep study, but she said they probably won't be able to do much about excessive sleep, it's mostly for people having trouble getting or staying asleep. But she said if/when my primary Dr rules out any non-depression related reason I'm so tired constantly, she could refer me to a sleep specialist. 

I'm sorry for the god-awful formatting and thank you again!","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Dealing with my first breakup / not going well,"My (M21) first girlfriend (F18) broke up with me 2 months ago after a 4 month relationship. I know it isn't that long, but we moved kind of fast and had high hopes form the beginning (it was both of ours first relationship). She wanted to stay a virgin till marriage and we same the same religious values, which I loved and respected so much which I think is part of the reason its so hard on me. But we did have some differences, yet I still tried to imagine a future with her even though I was never 100% sure. 

2 months later, and I'm dealing with it terribly. I keep imagining a future with her, constantly think about her, mope about it, bring it up with others to the point where I think I annoy them, and I seeing counseling for advice and to find out if I might have social anxiety and/or depression. Its just been so hard and I'm trying all of the advice that everyone is giving me, but she is the only thing on my mind and I debate on whether or not I was just in it for the relationship or her. At first I didn't know, but I really did love her, and still do. Some of my other friends are also going on dates and have girlfriends so I keep comparing it with them and wonder how they do it. I'm just in a rough spot and somedays I just want to end it. Thanks to anyone who listened or comments.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: she broke it off because she is transferring and switching majors, so its bringing a lot of stress into her life and doesn't feel like she has time for a relationship, and was starting to think because of that that we seem to have different futures in mind. Although now I am rethinking my entire future since she said that, and I didn't really know 100% what my future looked like, just that I wanted her in it.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

I took my best friend to Florida for a getaway in the hopes that it would help my depression. Worst. Mistake. Ever.,"Hi, first time posting here and I'm kinda a wreck right now so sorry if the formatting is a bit off.

So, I've been struggling with very severe depression, and even suicidal thoughts. I've been in touch with a mentor, and I suggested going to FL (I live in Virginia, and I have family in Florida) and she thought that would be a good idea, you know, get away from everything for a few days. So, I booked the trip and invited my best friend (who will remain nameless) to go with me. He quickly agreed (especially since he's been on suicide watch for me for over 3 months) and we got out tickets and all was dandy. 

Today, day 2 of said trip, I've completely lost my friend to the Fortnite video game. I've tried to do stuff with him, he politely declines. I've tried to talk to him, but as soon as I get sick (unfortunately, my main stress coping mechanism is vomiting, completely involuntary. I don't force it) he goes ba k to the game and when I need him the most when I've hit my lowest point (moments ago) he leaves. LEAVES!!

I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. I feel completely alone. Even my family (all except my dad) have used me out completely and taken to my friend instead.

I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do,"Sometimes I think that maybe I don’t really know what I want. I hate it. I hate how I look at other people and hate them. I hate when they smile, I hate when they laugh I hate how fucking happy everyone else is. I’m being left behind. I know I am, everyone is so far ahead of me and I’m drowning in my own damn mind.

 I can’t keep this up. I can’t keep smiling and pretending I’m cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. Who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that she’ll feel bad about ten minutes later. I don’t think I want to die. I just... I want to be free. But maybe freedom is death for me. 

I want to hit something. I want to yell and scream but at the same time I just want someone to hug me and tell me that it’s okay and that I matter. But that won’t happen. Not in a way that’s genuine and real, it’s all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. 

If I’m alone then maybe it’s better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. No one would really care if I go. I give them three months tops until I just become a distant name they remember every so often. Everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why can’t it stop I want everything to just fucking stop. 

I tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. They read straight off a damn script. Didn’t take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what I needed to get out. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like this my final chance to ask for help before I go back into a hole I may not be able to escape from again. I don’t trust anyone and those few that I do hole a level of trust for I don’t want to burden them so I smile and play it off as some edgy joke.

SO says it's depression linked. How to stop being too much?,"Hello (Lengthy post, so I'm sorry in advance if I waste your time),

I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesn't affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because other's have it worse (and most likely would be a waste on me anyway).

When I'm a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleagues/team mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as:

If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill / lounge around and still keep the job that's equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior.

My managers and colleagues say I'm too much and ""old""-friends have ended friendships due to me being ""too nice"".

At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe I'll ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that aren't enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse.

I have been told all my life I am too much, or just ""too"" something, but it's more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be ""enough"". Nothing more, nothing less.

This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didn't focus on helping others so much, but I didn't even realise I was focusing. She tells me I'm ""too nice"" about once a month.

After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression.

Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and don't know how to help,

I'm a Neuroscientist - Need your help with a science video on Depression,"I'm a Neuroscientist (PhD-Candidate in the Netherlands, originally from Austria) and on the side, I make science videos about the brain, human behavior, and biology (if you're curious: [https://www.youtube.com/c/Brainstorm2018](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brainstorm2018)).

Currently, I'm working on my next video which will be about Depression and I could use the help of this Community/subreddit. My background allows me to understand the science and psychology of depression but, luckily, I never have suffered from it myself (though I experienced it second-hand when my mum got a major depressive episode a few years back). So I want to add to the video by infusing it with personal stories and experiences of real people who have suffered or are suffering from depression.

**I have 2 questions**

1. What would be the single most important thing the 'public' gets wrong about Depression. What do people who never had any experience with it don't get?
2. If anyone wants to share a story or personal experience with depression that I could incorporate in the next video (anonymously without username if desired) I would be honored.

This is an amazing subreddit and I appreciate all your comments and feedback. Please feel free to ask me any questions.

All the best to all of you!

Philip

Is anyone in the same position as me?,"Hey this might be long but oh welll we all love a stranger that overshares and details their whole life out on the internet. 

Ok so I think I'm depressed. I'm lethargic, I'm apathetic, Im never happy, but never sad either. I always feel like this crazy heavy weight on my chest like loneliness. I feel just so lonely in this world. And I have friends. I have very close friends and an ex girlfriend I get on very well with. But I just feel like I'm everyone's second choice. 

I'm a really likeable guy. I haven't found a single person who has any problem with me. Like everyone likes me. But I feel like no one truly loves me.

My main thing is that I hate normalcy. I hate this feeling of ""okay"". Yet that's what my whole life is right now. I'm fairly good looking, I'm not poor, I'm not rich. There's nothing special about my life. And that's what I hate. I'm scared my future is me withering away into mediocrity. I'd rather be sad than how I am now because at least that's something.

I feel like I'm depressed but at the same time I don't. I don't hate myself

 (If anything I'm narcissistic, I have a very high self esteem)

Depressed people usually hate themselves. I don't cut, I don't cry, I don't ever really have a mad breakdown. I always think about how I'd kill myself but I know deep down I'd never actually do it. 

I'm none of that. 

But I'm not happy either.

Also, I lie a lot. I manipulate people close to me so I can get ahead. I always put myself first. Before anyone. Machiavellianism.

Then again, I dont know if I'm just exaggerating that to try seem ""edgy"" or different. Which I so crave to be. 

I dont know. 

For the longest time I thought I was some kind of psychopath because of the whole complete lack of empathy, manipulation, charm and general lack of feelings. But then I thought I'm probably just exaggerating that too to feel better about myself.

I crave labels. I crave being put into a box so I can belong to something. I can be recognised. I can be remembered.

"I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days.","I need help.

17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. 

I've been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. 

I've always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. 

I've always felt alone.

When I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge.

As I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldn't remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. 

My IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. 

Starting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldn't even look me in the eyes. 

I had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist.

Got medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still don't help me. I have no cure.

I feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. 

I've always been obsessive, but now it feels like it's all I am. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when I'm alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and I'm not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. 

I started going out to party's and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or I'll just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping I'll be something else, hoping I'll feel.

I've had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldn't feel anything for anyone (and no, not even her). I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didn't feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them.

I'm starting college in August, and I'll move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I don't kill myself soon, I'll do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. 

I fear it'll all colapse, and I'll truly break down. I fear I'll lose interest in my career, since it has already happened. I was going to study astrophysics, but after an episode I saw nothing in that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going crazy, always suffering. Everyday is pain, and I just want it to end. I am sick. 

I contemplate suicide everyday, but what ultimately stops me is just the possibility of a failed attempt, and getting scarred for many years to come, and always under watchful eyes after the attempt. 

The hurdle of death is my prison.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

I'm tired of thinking of exercise as a mere chore. I'm tired that I can't enjoy food anymore, and the fact that my mom cooks so much doesn't help. My family all says I'm lean and normal but I feel so disfigured. My shoulders are too broad and my arms are flappy making me look twice my size, my thighs are gigantic and are covered with cellulite. I really hate my mirrors and if I could break them I would. My weight is always in the middle of normal or overweight and one slice of cake could tip it off. I've been active and even trying to just eat healthy foods but I still hate myself. I think my thoughts have screwed over and long for the underweight body. At this point I think normal looks fat.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Im 14 and i already managed to fail my life,"hi guys, this is my first post on Reddit. I am only 14 years old. I've been suffering from depression ever since i was 12. I rarely feel happy anymore. Unfortunately these intense feelings have lead me onto a path of constant drug use which only makes my depression worse because I know i am smarter than that. I started smoking weed 2 years ago and obviously things have only gone downhill from then. I  am literally mentally and physically addicted to a fucking USB (Juul) and I've even found myself robbing weed dealers just because I thought that would make me feel sick but it only made things worse. I have been taking escitalopram since I was 11. Ever since I wet to high school I did a lot of stupid shit and now that I look back at it i purely did those things because of peer approval. These couple of years have literally felt like a lagging game. I haven't smoked in a day and I feel like complete shit. Theres probably a lot of things I left out because when i dont smoke for extended periods I feel dumb and slow. I made a Reddit account just to post this so please dont come at me with some bullshit jokes. I feel like ending my life my family is fighting as im writing this. Even typing a paragraph as simple as this feels mentally challenging. In elementary school my teachers would constantly say how smart i was and I would get 80s and 90s without studying and now I feel like because of the effect weed had on my brain I  wont be able to find a career later on in life.

F 15 struggling with depression and feeling hopeless. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Any advice?,"Hello Reddit. for a little backstory, I'm 15 years old and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just over two years ago. It has definitely gotten worse sense then, and I have not talked to a counselor since. Last November, I dropped out of my high school to begin home schooling with a tutor due to social anxiety and my depression hitting a low point. Though I enjoy the environment and freedom that comes with home schooling much better, it does get very lonely. The only people I talk to now are my long distance boyfriend, a couple online friends, and my family (who are very busy with their own work and school) Along with my family being busy, I hardly ever mention my depression to them. If I do, I feel like I'm wasting their time and they'll be disappointed in me. My depression has gotten increasingly worse over the past few months. I've always been skinny, but I've lost a significant amount of weight to the point it's unhealthy. I have no appetite, no desire to do anything, and no one to talk to. With the start of summer, my day consists of laying around and watching TV or playing video games. Even if plans do come up, physical symptoms of anxiety like panic attacks, head aches, and stomach aches typically prevent me from going. My boyfriend wants me to see a counselor, But I'm hesitant because the one I had previously didn't help much, and was very expensive. I worry that by asking my parent's for help, (with my anxiety, depression, and poor eating habits) I'll be wasting their money and time. At the same time, I'm afraid that if I continue to sit here and do nothing I won't live to see my 16th birthday. What should I do? Any tips on getting help and finding meaning and motivation in life at a young age?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0
Feelings of dread,"My chest always feels tight. It hurts. It makes me stay all day on the couch. I feel anxious all day....

Anyone knows this feeling? It gets worse when I really don’t do anything but this feeling kinda forces me to do so.

And then I start feeling guilty about not doing anything. I always ask myself “what can I do so I can feel better?” and my brain is looking for answers but I can’t find any! Because nothing makes fun or I just can’t get motivated because everything feels so dark..

"20 year old Male, why am I depressed....","I wake up in a house, my parents are the best and my relationship with them and my sister are better than ever. I just got accepted into Michigan State University where I am pursuing a Graphic Design degree. I have multiple internships for Graphic Design. Grades are A-B range. Everything in my life is going as best as it can be. Yet I still find my self having trouble sleeping at night, difficulty concentrating, a feeling of sadness, etc. The only thing I would say I am a little upset about is not being able to play soccer due to tearing my ACL back in November. I had surgery in April and should be back on the field in October. I try to exercise to the best of my ability, I try my best to eat as much as I can (appetite has been very low recently). The only thing that I find enjoyable is playing Video Games with my friends, its almost like a drug to me. Its my normal self again, but the second it's turned off, I down in the dumps again. Not sure what to do anymore. Everything in my life is going how I would want it to go, so why am I feeling depressed?

Downward spiral after being dumped by someone who was never even my bf,"I'm 31 F and have never had a boyfriend. I feel defective. After about a dozen dates or so I get dumped or guys start treating me like shit. 

I just got dumped by a really great guy. He said he wasnt ready for a relationship. Yet he messaged me first online, we texted almost daily for over a month, and went on real dates. I feel like this was the nice way of saying he just isnt that into me. He even met some of my friends. He told me I was the sweetest girl he ever dated. Then why would he never want to see me again?

I dont have much experience considering most people my age are at a minimum living with their partner if not married with kids. I cant figure out why I'm so undesirable. It's been like this ever since I was 16. I was always a secret. An embarrassment. 

I was doing so much better with my depression and now I'm back at square one. I'm randomly crying at work, I either feel intense pain or numb, I relive the act of being dumped and my stomach drops all over again, and  I'm seriously wondering if life is worth it if I never have someone love me.

I take meds, go to therapy. But it's not helping. I'm overweight so I cant help but think some of the reason why my dating pool sucks is because I'm ugly. I havent been eating really and when I do I purge. I've lost almost 4lbs this week. 

I feel like something very real is missing in my life and after yet another rejection I dont have any hope left.

What helps you get through the day?,"It's been four months since I turned eighteen and everything seems to be a mess for me. My depression is severe and it's getting the best out of me, my anxiety is consuming me and it hurts me badly. My ptsd (long story) really gets me to have these attacks where I'm not myself and I just experience more pain.

I've tried counseling for years, I've had depression ever since I was eleven and my mother passed away the day after mothers day.

I want to be able to support myself and try to find something that can help me get through the day.

So, my question is, what helps you get through the day? What thoughts do you think that help you get through it all? Coping strategies? (I play a lot of  video games but sometimes it's just not enough for me) Is there any way to express your feelings more appropriately and not have everything just overwhelm you and you explode?

Have recently started to come to terms with the fact that I'm a loser.,"While I am badly depressed, that is not the depression talking-- Other than the basement and the parents I meet the exact stereotypical requirements of a loser. While I have my reasons for the way I turned out-- I won't invoke them here so as to render them excuses. The fact is-- I have a personality like a moldy sponge-- covered in cooling diahria. That's not all that's holding me back though-- aside from a badly wrenched spine and triple hernias-- two of which are inguinal, the third one in my navel has never been patched-- my asthma has somehow gotten so bad that they briefly identified it as COPD. I don't think I'm quite staring down the barrel of that last depressive step yet-- but I'm at the stage where I see things for what they are and I feel them closing in. I live off of supplemental income-- I'm being thrown out of the room of the house I'm renting tomorrow to-- if not the street, than a rundown motel for a few days-- then the street. I have applications through for apartments-- that I had to rely on a ""friend"" that I basically leech off of to make for me-- because I just can't mentally handle having to do stuff like that for myself. I don't drive. I have no actual family-- most who meet me hate me straight off and the rest always do eventually-- so maybe that's ironically for the best. Bottom line; I'm waking up to myself, and realizing that I just can't ""me"" anymore. I'm not suicidal yet-- but I can hear it out there on the wind out there. Yet nor do I particularly care about self improvement. I just wanna be able to hack a passably comfortable life on my own merits-- with some real friends I'm not bleeding of their energy and resources-- who can honestly say they'd come to my funeral and actually mourn. In a nutshell: I want the misery to stop. I have no actual skills in much of anything, nor the basic knowledge of even how to obtain them-- while these things may not have been my fault to start with-- it seems the blame has-- in my thirties-- at least partially shifted to me. I don't like that, I don't like ME-- I just need this shit to end.

I just want a hug.,"I'm 16, male, and I have no idea where I'm going.

Everyone around me wants to do something with their lives, they have their shit figured out, and they know where they want to go and what they want to do. I have no clue.

I've taken test after test trying to figure out where I'm supposed to be, but nothing fits. All I want to do is sit down and rest. 

I spend 99% of my time doing *stuff*. I'm on a competitive rowing team, I'm a straight A student, and I'm finishing up my Eagle Scout rank. All of this work, and I feel like nothing is coming out of it. I feel empty.

I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel lost. 

And that's only half of my issue. 

I just want to be hugged, I want someone to cuddle and talk with, but nobody's there. I want to feel like I matter to someone other than my family, I want to share my life with someone. But I can't do that. Not at this age. 

I'm just so mad about it, I feel like crying and giving up on all of it, but I know that would only make it worse.

I'm 20 and I kinda sorta hate myself,"Sup I'm 20 and I genuinely feel hopeless and hate myself. I don't really feel like there's anything in my life to be super proud of, like I've been unemployed for a few months, I don't have a drivers license, I've never had a girlfriend, I'm not in super great shape and I hate myself for not taking steps to change anything. It's like I'd rather just wallow in my own sadness then actually go do something about it even though all I want to do is be happy. I don't want to sound like the stereotypical 4chan incel but the never having a girlfriend part especially bothers me, like to the point where if I see a pretty girl in public or I see someone my age on social media being in a nice relationship or something I get like jealous and sad, and I don't want to be like that I should be happy for those people but I'm just not. I feel like such a huge loser who is going to be stuck just loathing myself forever. Any of my friends or family members I've spoken to have told me it will get better and I'm a great dude but it just doesn't make me feel any less worthless to myself. I'd appreciate anything anyone has to say.

Help with depression,"Hello everyone, 

This is my first time on reddit and my first time posting. I am sure many people face issues that are much worse than mine, but I don't know what to do anymore other than ask for help. English is not my first language so I apologise for any mistakes. 

For context: I am 24 yo, female,  with a stable job and a loving boyfriend. By all means I should be happy right? Well I started feeling more and more depressed a few months ago and so far, it hasn't changed. I don't feel like eating and have lost weight, I don't feel like going out or hanging out with people and I could literally spend my whole day sleeping (which I did for the past two days, missing work), I often find myself crying for no reason and I don't enjoy anything anymore. 

My boyfriend is abroad for a while because of his studies, and so I am able to hide from him most of the time. But it's getting harder and harder and I think he is starting to lose patience. Our last two conversations was him telling me that he is sick of me moaning every two days and crying for no reason.

This is not the first time I have been depressed, and usually it follows something bad, but this time I feel like it's all in my head  and it's Something that I can't get out of. It's starting to impact my job, my Relationship and everything else in my life...Do any of you have any advice for me?

"Discord is awful, and I'm crying.","When I ask to join a server with all my old friends who disliked me, I get a blatant ""fuck no"" from probably all the moderators. Everyone there is my friend, and I just want to feel happy again when being with my old friends.

I know I hurt my friends emotionally, but I've changed and I'm doing better. But... They just won't move on, and them not moving on lead me to doing bad things to myself (cutting, hurting myself, contemplating suicide). My life doesn't feel the same anymore.

Yes, I've gotten a few disabilities from trauma. Alexithymia, higher emotional sensitivity, voices in my head, anxiety. It sucks. I wish it would go away.

I wish I had friends. Real ones I could hug and kiss. So I can be happy. My current new friends on Discord think I'm a snowflake because of how sensitive I am, but I always try to explain what I've been through and why I act certain ways.

I don't know what to do," 

I just graduated from high school recently and I thought that would help with all my anxiety but I'm just sitting in my room feeling lifeless. I don't sleep or eat regularly, and I barely know the time. The past 5 years have been really difficult for me, and I've only had 2 people to talk to, one being a school counsellor. I think they just prolonged whatever I have but nothing really helps. I stopped having constant suicidal thoughts since 3 months ago, but it was so sudden and I just feel this lethargic tiredness always lurking. I don't know if it's residual or it's because everything's physically taking a toll on me.

Even when everything I thought was giving me stress was over, nothing changed.

And I have been trying to go out and meet my friends. I’ve been out of my house more these days than most of my life combined.

I thought whatever I was feeling might have been situational but I don't think it is. I've tried swallowing pills a bunch of times and hurting myself and nothing happened, so I took that as a sign to try to be more healthy, but it's not really working. I felt completely fine and then a few weeks ago I took 24 colored pills and thought maybe something would happen, and I just ended up with nausea and a stomach ache. That's not normal, is it? I even took cough syrup with it. I don't get how nothing can happen, and I really don't get why I'm still doing these things when I'm not under stress (which is usually the only reason I would hurt myself when it all started).

I can't meet a paid professional because my parents wouldn't ever believe me. They're not bad people but they're ignorant and misguided, and that mental illnesses only exist for people with 'real trauma'. They'd say I was lying or faking it. And believe me, I've tried approaching the topic with them. I had 2 panic attacks in front of them and they still wouldn't let me meet a mental health counsellor even when we went to the hospital and the doctor recommended it.

What's wrong with me? I'm just stuck. I don't even know why I'm making this post. I think maybe writing about it helps, but honestly maybe I'm just trying to reach out for help. I'm not really sure about my feelings at this point.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1

My Government won't support my parents any longer for having me,"Disclaimers: Never posted on reddit before, but I don't know who else to talk to.   
The grammar will be off because I am quite upset as I type this, my apologies. 

  
Quick backstory: I've suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now I'm soon-to-be 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. 

Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still haven't finished university. I'm trying but failing. I'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I don't get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because I'm too old to count as a child. 

I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. They're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, I know she's growing impatient. She's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. 

  
I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ""ending it all so they'll be better of"" take over. Because I know my mom won't be better of knowing I've commited suicide. I don't want to die. I just can't live.  Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?

  
I should talk to my therapist about this, I know.

Does therapy really help?,"New to Reddit. I (26, female) have been suffering from depression since 18, when I started college. I’ve also recently developed anxiety disorder within the year. My depression is crippling and I don’t remember that last time I’ve actually felt happiness. I’m always stressed and anxious. I can’t focus. I feel anxiety around my lifelong friends and boyfriend.  I feel unloved. I’ve failed in my career. I’ve gained weight. I just don’t love myself. Though I’ve suffered for a long time with what I would say is SEVERE anxiety, I have not seeked help yet. I always think I can help myself..but obviously not. I’m wondering if therapy really helps. I want to avoid medication at all costs.

These past few weeks have been tough. I’ve been bottling it all in and I’m just so tired. I’ve noticed signs of depression through an increase in sensitivity, time spent crying which went from nothing to suddenly tearing up at night.. I’ve noticed myself being unable to clean my room or find energy to go work out, and I either sleep too long and feel guilty or spend all night awake exhausted but unable to sleep. I’m so tired. I can’t do anything, I can’t even hang around my friends because it feels like they hate me or I’m not good enough. I either try to starve myself to feel the pain of hunger or overeat to get rid of the pain. I have no one to talk to. I feel guilty and I’m not diagnosed so I’m wondering if I’m just faking it, but I’m too scared to bring it up to my doctor because last time she brushed it aside.

Cleaning service?,"I feel lots of shame posting this.

I pretty much live in my partner's room (she lives with roommates). Both of us have depression &amp; anxiety symptoms flaring up, and she has chronic pain. We've been very isolated to our room. It's already been cluttered and disorganized by her move 1 year ago, and since we have very little energy, it's more and more cluttered, including boxes of take-out.

Its state affects us very much and though we've tried again and again to gain motivation and energy to at least do small things, we haven't been able to do much.

We talked a few times about reaching out for someone to clean and reorganize our room. I also know a few skill-trading groups where I could ask for help, and offer some kind of compensation. I also thought of asking friends for help, but I'm scared of imposing. We don't have that much money either, but honestly we haven't been able to do much for a while now and I just need help to take a step forward. I just feel like I'm being very lazy doing so.

I made a suicide plan and it scares me,"I'm not intending to commit suicide. But I came up with a plan, for the event that I changed my mind, I guess.

I have a neurological disorder that causes chronic pain and muscle spasms, and I feel like it's deteriorating my normal level of function. I have considered myself high-functioning for a long time. I've been in and out of therapy (currently out) for years, but it's never been helpful. 

Therapists have told me I seem very self-aware, but that I'm closed off. It's a struggle to talk to anyone about anything personal, especially if it's negative. So this is really hard for me, to post like this. I'm hoping the anonymity of the internet makes it easier.

Morning disgust,"Hello there. Been diagnosed with severe depression two years ago. Now i got rid of medications, and there has been no problem for month or two.

"I feel my life is worthless, I'm ready to end it all, please help me. I've posted for help, and I don't know where to turn to now. I feel more depressed now than ever before in my life.","I've posted about my current situation in other subreddits asking for advice, people don't believe me. I don't know what to do. My posts get removed, I do not know why.

Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu and other subreddits.

Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please!

I've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where I'm coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldn't even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadn't, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced.

Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved; after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks I'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didn't just savior my time there I indulged in it, there I'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time I'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didn't care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her ""Mandy"", and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several ""business trips"" to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. I'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, I've seen garbage fires that look better than her. Mandy always gave excellent blowjobs, its like she had lips of an angel, unlike my wife who never gave me oral. But that's when everything went to shit. Mandy came to me two weeks ago, and stated she's pregnant. She took a test, and showed me the results. I don't know what to do, I can't let my wife, or kids find out. Mandy is threatening to tell my wife, about her, and the baby. She has been calling he angrily about this, she blames me for her pregnancy, but she wants to keep that baby. She tells me she doesn't want to be ""just the other woman."" She doesn't want to be ""a dirty little secret."" I don't know what to do. I got so angry at that fucking bitch, we got into a heated argument. I haven't been going to work for the past few days now, I've been making sure Mandy doesn't come to my house, if she does, I'm thinking of calling the cops on that thug. I can't let my wife, or my kids know the truth. I need your help, please, what should I do? I need help, and advice. I want to save the marriage, I can't let my kids go through a divorce, my wife still does not know anything. I hate this whole fucking situation. I hate my life, why the hell would this happen to me?? How can I convince Mandy not to tell my wife? I don't know what to do, should I get a restraining order on her? Please help me anyone, I don't know who to go to for help.

TL:DR had several affairs with women I met at nightclubs, hit it off really well with one, now she's pregnant, and wants to tell my wife!

Please help me, I don't want to live anymore, I'm thinking of running off, maybe buying a shotgun. Where can I turn to? Help please anyone. My life is worthless. I feel numb inside.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those who’ve dealt with it longer than I - how?,"So I’m a 20 y.o. F who’s currently on her sophomore year in college. 
I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. 
Since then I’ve dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. 
Since starting school I’ve realized I’ve become incredibly isolated. The only time I’ll have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I won’t have a conversation with anyone.  Even my parents don’t talk to me everyday. 
I’ve joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? 
My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that I’m training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies don’t care if you have depression - they need to be trained. 
I’ve also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly don’t see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. 
I just don’t know how I’m supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on- just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably? 
I just need to hear from more experienced depressed individuals- how did you survive?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just want to quit everything and say @&amp;*% it, need advice","Long story 

20yo, 3rd year in college and having a very rough patch. I was one of those “gifted” kids that never studied which started biting me in the butt once I got to IB high school. Got burnt out before I even got to college. Had issues with depression in high school as well. 

Fast forward to today and this semester isn’t even half way over and I’m pretty sure I’m going to fail 4/6 of my classes, I have no motivation to do anything nor can I make myself care about not failing exams. I would hate the professors but I just feel too exhausted to give a crap about them. Half the time I don’t show up to classes, even the ones I liked at the beginning of the semester, and when I do show up I’m sitting staring at a wall or rewatching a dumb video on reddit or instagram or whatever. 

I’ve regularly had suicidal thoughts since high school about jumping off a parking garage or crashing my car but I know I’ll never do it because of my family and my pet and responsibilities or whatever. 

I know I need to work at it and all but I can’t seem to find the “light at the end of the tunnel”. I can feel anxious about failing a class but I can’t bring myself to really care about it. My best friend says I’m just burnt out and my therapist is considering medication. I just don’t know what to do or how to get past just pushing through and get to “living for myself”. Not sure if this all made sense. 

TLDR: lack of motivation doesn’t even come close to describing how I feel about life. Not sure if medication helps this or not and could use some advice in general on how to get through depressive episodes.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Im 21 yrs old, have never kissed a girl, the loneliness is killing me","**Sorry for the rant:** So yea, it kinda sucks - I was never the popular kid in school really and honestly didnt have many friends back in highschool, and have only had 1 actual girlfriend (I had 2 others during junior high but...you know...those dont count as it was junior high and they only lasted like 1 week each lol) who had what ill call ""bad character traits"" for someone you want to have as your girlfriend. Ive come to terms with it and am fine with it since im in the adult world now and have more to focus on, however I cant help feel depressed as im going to be finished college within a year, going to be buying a 2 part house with my parents eventually and actually start my career and adult life but I cant ever seem to get girls to even look at me and its honestly depressing. 

Ontop of that even if girls *were* interested in me I wouldnt know how to read any signs or know a good way to ask them out - the closest I came was last year with a girl in one of my classes but I heard her talk about her boyfriend and that kinda put a stop to any thoughts about dating her around then. Adding to this im always feeling lonely most of the time, as pretty much all my friends in college have girlfriends or have atleast have had a better and more eventful relationship then me. Its getting to the point where im thinking to myself im just not one of those people persons because i generally work better by myself, and will end up growing old and alone except being that kind of person terrifies me because thats now how I want to live my life. Anyway I guess thats my first rant on here, I would appreciate any advice someone can give me to help stop the loneliness or be more of a people person, going to post this in the other sub and see if I can get any help there.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please help me. I cant fucking do this.,"I cant fucking do this. I cant fucking do this. Its been so goddamn long since ive actually felt happy.
I hate myself and i dont really feel like i have anything to look forward to. Ive tried it all, meds, therapy, hobbies,tv shows, books, work. Nothing works. Im still at sqaure one. I still come home ever day barely keeping myself from just ending it.
No one would miss me. Im so fucking generic and useless. Im not even a good person. Truth be told, im defensive and hot tempered to the point where anyone that has made an effort to get closer to me is driven away pretty early. I feel like i have no control over this nightmare rather im just along for the ride. 
Ive tried, i genuinely tried and nothing works.
I feel so isolated.
Im so alone.
I cant tell whats real and whats not.

Not that anyone here really cares, i guess part of me hopes someone will tell me something i havent heard before, some actual advice , thats worked for other people- or at the very least give me a reason not to curl up and die.
Or ill just get the whole ""it doesnt work like that"" thing

How do I forgive myself?,"7 years ago I met this amazing girl on Instagram when we were both 13.  She lived in Ohio and I was from Massachusetts. We talked as friends and grew into a relationship. At the time I knew I wanted her for the rest of my life but I still fell into selfish ways. I would break up with her and talk to other girls. While she just waited cause she was head over heals for me and then we’d get back together and that happened countless times.. the final time I broke up with her I really didn’t want to. I was taking advice from my dad because some stuff went down and we were going to meet in person again for another summer and we’d already been talking for 3 years online. So I asked my dad if I should wait till next summer to finally take the chance? I was angry that we couldn’t see each other and I was upset.. we’d been planning all year to meet this time and it was ruined because of some stupid stuff she did with her friends.. my dad told me that eventually I’d find someone else and I shouldn’t waste my youth on one relationship when there’s thousands of different chances.. so I broke up with her.. it was one of the hardest parts of her life. She was alone and hurting because I left her again.. I had a itch in the back of my mind that “this isn’t what you want don’t make the same stupid mistakes again, you’re in love with her..” a few weeks go by or maybe months and she found someone else. A physical relationship and I just broke. I said some really cruel things to her, very very cruel things.. she told me “I want you to hurt like you hurt me” and I went ballistic and i said “fine you want to see me hurt?” And I proceeded to cut my self at least a hundred times on my thighs and repeatedly sending her pictures of what I was doing and she begged me to stop and she cried and she pleaded and I just wouldn’t.. years go by she’s been in a few relationships and we don’t talk.. I find a girl who abused me but I took it because I felt that’s what I deserved.. she cheated on me and left me, I was having a breakdown and the girl from Ohio would occasionally check on me. She saw that we broke up and she messaged me. Her relationship with her last boyfriend wasn’t really working out and they broke up so we decided to talk again as friends and help each other out.. she eventually went to a mental hospital because she wanted to kill herself but I called her everyday she was there.. we had amazing conversations and I could tell she was starting to feel okay now that she was taking medication and getting some therapy.. when she got out I bought her a plane ticket and she came to see me, spent a month here and everything was going amazing and we started dating again.. when she went home I really missed her, we’d talk on the phone and text and stuff but I really missed her. I was supposed to fly out in November so I can be there for her birthday but I begged she’d come back in October cause I missed her so much, because of that she missed her appointments and couldn’t get her medication and stuff and she’s been here for a bit now. But she doesn’t want to be with me.. the month before everything seemed okay. It was like we were in love again and she said that she thought she was but now that she’s off her medication she’s falling back into her old toxic behaviors she started developing after the things I did to her.. we argued a lot the first week she was here and I wish I would’ve just kept my mouth shut and I wish that I would’ve just went in November because we’d probably still be together right now.. she leaves October 24th and it kills me seeing her here knowing that I had her again.. knowing I was a lot better.. but she doesn’t want me anymore.. she says she doesn’t want anyone for awhile until she can love herself.. and there’s basically no chance I’ll have her back.. how do I forgive myself? How do I stop hating myself? How do I love myself? How do I let her go? How do I stop these suicidal thoughts? I’d really appreciate some advice.. I know I don’t deserve sympathy.. that’s not what I want.. I want to be okay..

Need help,"


So I usually don’t do this and I’m not sure if anyone will respond but I just feel like I need to say something, for the last 2 years I have been at rock bottom, I don’t have anyone to reply on at the end of the day it’s just me. Everyone I talk to I just can’t connect with and I just feel like they don’t like me or care about me or anything I have to do with. I don’t do anything to make people hate me I just put it in my head and it begins to spread into the relationship with people. My co workers who say they are my friends say they care about me but when they see that I’m in a depressed mood they don’t do anything. I just feel like they are only in my life because of work. I have been thinking in my head every day that the world would be a better place if I weren’t in it people would just be happier to not have to deal with me. I even go to the point where I will make up reasons or find reasons to prove my point, even if I’m taking to a wrong way. I do this in every situation and just keep telling myself people don’t care about me and ride the proof to make it true. It makes me feel like The world would be better off with out me.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Life’s going downhill and everything that happens is mainly my fault,"For starters I’m 13 years old. I’m in the 7th grade and this issue has been going on for what I’d say about a year now.


I don’t know if what’s going on even is depression, maybe I’m just being edgy. To be frank, I have no idea anymore. The more I stress about it the more I try talking about it with my friends, and sometimes they ignore it, other times they tell me to stop being emo. Also, FYI, this will be really long.


The fact of the matter is that things haven’t been going well. We can start at my grades. You see, my brother (age 25) is a collage dropout and my sister (age 21) is still doing great and I’m happy for her. The thing is that because my brother had dropped out of collage (he has a job now and is starting to get back  on track) and is still living with my parents and struggling, I feel this pressure that I need to do well and be the best I can to not end up like him. I’m sure that’s normal, but the one problem is my mother.

I always try to satisfy her, seeing the smile and satisfaction on her face is my dream, but she never seems to be satisfied. If I brought home B’s that wasn’t good enough. If I got an answer wrong on my test even though I still got a good grade it wasn’t good enough because I got something wrong. When I brought home my interim, I got 3 B’s and 4 A’s and when she saw, all she did was ask if I needed help because my grades were dropping. It hurt me. She wants me to become an orthodontist. When I brought home this report thingie on my level (1-5) on english and writing, I got a level 5. (Only 7% of students in my state got that.) However there was also one for science and math, I got a level 4 on that, which is what most people in my state got. When she saw, she told me to do better because I math and science are more important for becoming a orthodontist. I feel helpless.


My next issue is this incident that happened with my crush. Now I’m assuming it’s normal to crush on people when you’re 13, right? Well this one was my fault. I was texting my friend on discord, and we brought the topic up. We were just joking around, and then I said something, a little more... questionable. He laughed at it, and so did I, because say what you will about it, it was pretty funny. We’re both in this discord server with a lot of people from our school in it, including my crush. However, one time when I was on the server, we were teasing each other. Normal, right? But then I got this dm saying “shut up or I’ll leak the photo” or something around those lines. I was like “um... okay” because even though I knew what he did was technically black mail, I didn’t want the photo to be leaked so I just shut up. This threat continued a couple more times until this happened. He didn’t leak it to the chat, but he showed it to some of my friends. They were like “bruh wtf” and I explained the context of the image and how I didn’t mean anything I actually said. But then he showed it to this one person, and it was this boy my crush is e-dating. I was on the server, when I got a dm from him saying “I’ll leak the photo to the server.” When I pleaded him not to, he just said “Yes” and then sent the photo into the server, where everyone saw, including my crush (his girlfriend). I was miserable. I left the server and went to bed, talking to myself about how I should just kill myself tonight (we’ll get to that soon) and end it all. It was a while ago, and the drama seemed to die down, but I had to explain to my crush everything and she seemed to have forgiven me. However, people still bring it up and show the image, especially when my crush is still around. I beg to them not to as it obviously makes her uncomfortable but they won’t stop, my sin won’t leave me, no matter what I do. It’s still on my back, and this one kid won’t leave me alone about it, and he antagonizes me about it. The sad truth is that I can’t blame anyone. It was my fault, I shouldn’t of said that. Ironically the week after this happened our school got a presentation on cyber safety.


My last issue, and arguably the one that makes me sad and angry, are my friends. I don’t think it’s their fault. I believe it’s just mine for acting stupid and making so many horrible choices, so I can’t blame them. But they never have anything good to say about me. Ever since kindergarten, I was constantly being reminded of how stupid and idiotic I was. Now they won’t leave me alone for how much of a disappointment I am, how I’m stupid, and they constantly make fun of me and won’t leave me alone for my mistakes, as well as making up lies. Hell, one friend is calling me a pedophilia because I like Asian girls and they’re shorter than me or some shit, even though the ones I sorta like are in my age group. If there’s an argument on the bus, I’m the main problem because I spook to loudly and disturbed everyone. If I had an argument with someone and we have a fight, they always bring up a point that makes me realize I’m the wrong one. No matter how much I compliment them, they never have anything good to say back aside from my idiotic ignorance. 


Overall, I want to commit suicide more than anything. The thing is, I just can’t being myself to because 1. It’s forbidden in the Bible 2. What would my parents think? I can’t just leave them. But still, regardless of all of that, I still want to end my life and go with the Lord. However, the moment I see the Lord, I’m going to see the gate of hell for all my sins and what I have done. I’m vulgar, perverted, violent, etc. And then, not to repeat myself, but everything is still my fault. If there’s an argument I started it. If something bad happened I’m the one who did something illegal. If I’m not 100% perfect like my friends I’m a failure. I’m just done with life, and as much as I want to end it, Christianity won’t allow it. The very thing that’s saving me (even with my parents I would’ve killed myself a LONG time ago if it weren’t for my Christian faith) is also imprisoning me. Again, I’m not sure if I’m depressed, it’s possible I’m just being emo. But if anyone can provide any advice as to what to do, I’d greatly appreciate it. Have a good night.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
Alone in a new country. Feeling terrible.,"I'm so lonely. I just moved to another country with my boyfriend. It's a non English speaking country and I'm feeling so incredibly alone. My boyfriend immediately got a job and he's working long hours, meanwhile I'm at home alone just waiting for him to come back.

I've had depression and anxiety for years and years, it was slowly getting better but I still had my rough days from time to time. I feel like a complete failure, and I feel so stupid for hoping that this move would make me feel better. 

I feel like an imposter and like I don't belong anywhere. I don't deserve to be anywhere or have any chances in life because there are so many better people out there than me. 

I'm so terrified of looking of looking for a job that I just keep putting it off. I have no desirable skills, I can't speak the language. Who in their right mind would employ me?

I was honestly doing so well for the first month since I got here, loving the country and just feeling fresh and new.  I posted on an expat subreddit for the country I've moved to (on a different account) with a question I had, because I honestly had no idea where else to ask it. 

I tried so hard to phrase the question in the best, clearest, most polite way possible, because I was worried about being a burden. 

There were a few people who answered my question and were helpful but it got downvoted a lot, because someone reposted my post on a different subreddit made for making fun of people. And the repost got so many upvotes. It had people in the comments calling me retarded, and a fuckwit and stupid and just generally shitting on me.

I wish I never posted anything, I'm probably going to regret posting this as well. I'm so completely crushed. I've never been bullied this badly before. I don't trust anyone anymore. I've used this new account to post this because I'm so terrified of these people following me around on any different posts I make.

I really thought that it was going to be a nice community. I wanted to make friends and get advice from people in the same situation as me. But now it feels like everyone is just a huge jerk, and I'm the worst person in the world for daring to move to ""their"" country. (They're expats too!) 

It's making me feel so terrible. I haven't been able to get out of bed for days. I wake up in the night sobbing. I've stopped eating. I feel like I'm not wanted in this country. I'm feeling so stupid for thinking that moving here was a good idea. 

I feel stupid for being upset about it too. They were calling me a ""snowflake"" for just calmly asking about how to do a simple thing I didn't know how to do. So me being upset just proves them right. Everything they said about me is just the truth. I say it to myself everyday anyways. 

I feel bad telling my boyfriend how I feel because he works really hard all day, and comes home late and really tired. I don't want to bother him by complaining about my problems. I've already talked a lot with him about it all, and he's really good at trying to make me feel better and listening to me. But I just feel so guilty, so I keep a lot of it in. And I don't want to message my family back home because I don't want them to worry. It's my first time living out of home. I don't want to make my problems anyone elses problems. 

I even feel guilty posting here. I'm just so pathetic. Dramatic. fuck i hate myself.

I don't even have enough karma on this account, so this is probably just going into the void. But at least its out of my brain.

My friend has been having lots of suicidal thoughts lately.,"I have known him for a year now, and he’s studying abroad rn and I’m still study at our homeland. He has been telling me about how he wants to kill himself lately, and reply less and less to my texts, or sometimes he just straight up ignored my texts and then came back with a text about killing himself. He has never talked about dying this much throughout the whole time we’ve known each other. I tried to talk to him, make him feel loved and other things that I think that can help him clear his mind a bit, but I don’t really know if that can help him or not because he’s so far away.

He used to use antidepressants but he has stopped for quite a while now and he once confessed to me that he doesn’t want to visit therapist or use antidepressants again.

Can any of you here help me with some advice please? He is a close friend of mine, and I’d die if he decides to stop living.

Just like stay away from everyone, where no one that you know, knows where you are. And you just go improve on yourself, fix what needs fixing, and comeback better than ever.

The Story of This Year,"# 

I’m a 22y/o male and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didn’t cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family.

I’m having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. I’m in my 4th year of uni and I’ve failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, I’ve been seeing counsellors and doctors and I’m on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so I’m going to talk about my year and how’s it’s been the worst and best year I’ve had in a very long time.

So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldn’t with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who I’ll call Max, we hit it off straight away and I’ve never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live.

A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our “flat” (8 bedroom house sorta thing) was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me. They are very honest people and they told me before moving that I shouldn’t, that it wouldn’t work out and that the people I’m moving in with aren’t who I think they are and it won’t work out. Me being stubborn ignored all their warnings. I have this bad habit of meeting someone and when I get along with them as well as I did with Max, I latch on and I just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly.

Back to the story, I ended up moving in with these 3 people. It was bloody fantastic, I had the most amazing time with them. We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now I’ve done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when I’ve taken MDMA I’ve only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and that’s all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldn’t handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that I’ve ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month I’ve never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I haven’t had a great life and the smallest things get to me.

After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 12:30am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs- specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didn’t have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldn’t anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didn’t have the tension and added stress.

(I’m sorry this story jumps a lot, there’s so much content that I can’t really focus)

I didn’t realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60% of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I don’t deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her; which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and that’s the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to $700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldn’t think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they weren’t happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didn’t visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didn’t visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didn’t want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space.

I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor I’ve actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didn’t want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them.

I lost my two best friends, and my brother.

It’s been just over 2 months since I’ve moved out and I’m still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchat’s together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease I’m in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still haven’t paid, and unable to afford. I’ve taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I don’t know what to do.

The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I haven’t stopped crying, I’ve been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me. I can’t stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and it’s hard to see the positive ahead. I’ve lost my dog, my 2 best friends, I’m a couple thousand dollars in debt, I’m failing uni and my head is so fucked up I can’t think straight. Suicide is constantly on my mind and I can’t help but think it’s the only way out. I don’t know what to do or who to speak too. I can’t take out anymore loans and I hate asking for help from the people I love and care about. So I’m coming to reddit for some advice, some positive thoughts or anything. I’m lost and hopeless and I think it’s coming to the end of my time. How do I get past this? I don’t think I can do this anymore.

She’s my friend, so of course I do my best to be there for her and listen to her problems but at the same time, it’s becoming a toxic situation because I’ve been feeling pretty down myself, and it’s been taking a toll on my emotion well-being. I honestly don’t mean to sound selfish at all, I really want to help her but I feel like it’s too much for me to handle.

It’s a tough situation because I feel like I’m not fit to be her emotional support as I’m going through things myself and I haven’t been feeling great for a while but I don’t think I can tell her that, I know she’s going through a lot.
Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i don’t know how to reply to her, I don’t know how to handle it. 
Feels like we don’t talk about anything else other than her problems, and I really want to help but it’s so hard.

I know she relies on me for support a lot.

It’s been a few years since this has been happening. She’s always coming to me, and I’m pretty sure only me and I feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness. 

I don’t want her to feel like she’s a burden to me, though I can’t help feeling this way.

Has anyone been in this sort of situation ? What can I do?

Feeling Lost and Weak,"Hi there, um, I don’t really know how else to start this, so I’m just gonna go, okay? okay.

I’ve struggled with severe anxiety and depression for basically my whole life. Or maybe not my whole life, it’s hard to remember, but definitely after my mother died. Car accident. Nasty business. I was 12, I saw it happen. I think I’ve been broken ever since then.

It got worse and worse and worse over the course of a decade. I went from honors student, “”gifted””, to dropping out of college. My brain felt like it was clogged up with glue. But I told myself it was all my own fault, that I was just lazy, selfish, immature. Making excuses.

I’ve seen some doctors, therapists too, most of them were incredibly unhelpful. The stress of dealing with the medical system outweighed any help I got from them. Any medications they tried to make me feel better were duds at best.

I went through a really, REALLY bad period about 3-4 years ago. I lost my entire group of friends, and let myself be abused by my partner for far longer than I should. I turned to self-harm, it was the lowest point I’d been in my life. I still see the scars when I look in the mirror.

But then I started to get better! I got new friends, got a job, allowed myself to be proud for once. I stopped self harming, swore never to again. Even after getting sexually harassed by my (thankfully ex) boss, even after losing my grandfather to cancer, I kept it together...for about a year and a half.

Almost exactly one year ago I got hit by a car as I was crossing the street. Physically I was mostly unharmed, but it brought back all those memories from the accident where I lost my mother. I started becoming irritable, lethargic, occasionally manic, and the panic attacks...at one point I was having full panic attacks ever single day.

I knew I needed help, but I felt powerless to get it. I had to leave my old clinic because the stopped taking my insurance. I wanted to switch to insurance through work but I’d already missed the cutoff date. I wouldn’t be able to apply for another year....

I almost made it. But I was unspooling too fast. I ended up leaving that job before I could get the help I needed. But that was fine, I had enough savings to get me through a month or two, I could find a new job.

That was, I don’t even know, three months ago? I haven’t even applied. I just...can’t find the energy. I know I need help, I know I’m really sick, but I just...can’t move. I’ve had the website for a local therapist open in my tabs the whole time (one that I can email, because holy hell phonecalls are an anxiety nightmare even when I’m feeling sane) but everytime I go to reach out I just get paralyzed by anxiety and uncertainty, and I just can’t find the will to muster through it. I haven’t gone back to self-harming but I’m so afraid of ending up back in that place again, it’s been a struggle. I just don’t know what else to do. I just don’t know what I CAN do?! I’ve been exhausted all day but I can’t even sleep. And I feel like I’m crying but my face is utterly still

Fuck I’m sorry this wasn’t supposed to be nearly this long. If you read all that, thanks, sincerely.

I thought I was getting better but it’s been extra rough lately,"I felt like for the first time in years, I felt consistently happy/at peace for a solid week or so (minimal bad thoughts, good vibes all around). I wasn’t kept up every night thinking or doing trash habits. But suddenly i crashed and felt trapped, pessimistic, and done all over again.

Maybe it’s part of the process, but it’s still going and I can’t find my groove back from that week. 

I feel really alone since I don’t want to bother people around me and the ones I trust have a lot on their hands rn so it’s kinda bad timing all around.

Over the past few years it’s gotten bad and started to impact my health; id pass out a lot, have panic attacks, all the jazz. I just got put on antidepressants for the migraines and all. But I’m sure it isn’t that since the pills shouldn’t start working yet (it hasnt even been a week).

I’m kinda on the edge of just dropping college and just not trying anymore bc it’s so hard to keep up my grades with all this. Plus the pressure doesn’t help; from solid 4.0s and As to barely making the minimum :( 

I guess it kinda was a rant but also, 
what do you guys do to get better? Or
If you’ve gone through it, what happened for you:(

It’s kinda been a cycle but this one was the longest I’ve felt okay

How do I escape from this labyrinth of suffering ?,"I’m depressed. Not the kind of depression that’s like ‘oh hey I’ve been feeling down lately and need some help’... it’s more like 

‘I’m going to kill my self at the end of the summer and nothing is going to stop me.’

And I keep thinking of my boyfriend and how sad he will be. I keep thinking of my sister and her children and how she will have to explain to them that I’m not around anymore. I can hear them crying. I keep thinking of my friend that I haven’t spoken to in a while because I’m so frustrated with her and she’s in another country. I can hear her yelling at me.

"My girlfriend is suffering from depression, and I’m looking for some advice on how I can be more supportive.","For some context, we’ve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. She’s been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and it’s been especially bad in recent weeks. She’s a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not she’s making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I can’t cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently she’s been saying she doesn’t feel like it’s fair for me to have to deal with her when she’s like this, and she’s worried that’s it’s having a negative impact on our relationship. I’ve never really had to deal with depression as closely as I am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. I always try to be supportive, letting her know that I’m here for her and that I love her. It’s been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting. Sorry if this post has been a little lengthy, I haven’t had the chance to talk to anyone other than her about it. I appreciate any advice you guys can share.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further,"Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that I'm finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? I'd rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75/hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I can't imagine doing that because that'll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. I've seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they can't keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said I'm 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, I'm still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 12-14 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise I'm alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because I'm too depressed to even crave food, I can tell I'm hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless I'm smoking weed. I've tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. I'd rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for (money) green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just don't understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of  way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my time/life away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone (Including every single person close to me even teachers) started making fun of me saying things like ""crackhead"" or ""you look like an old man"", ""you look like a hobo"", ""Looks like Albert Einstein"", ""Do you wash your hair?"" and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire junior/senior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but there's always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me  how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is ""illegal"" to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that I'll be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent.  (or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life) Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone else's rule?  Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who don't have to live by human code? I'd literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just don't know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100% don't blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position I'm in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. I'd love to have two children but if they had to go through what I'm going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isn't something I'd want to give to someone else its just not worth it. I'm too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time it'd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless. There's a gun safe in my brothers room and just about every day I just imagine how peaceful it'd be after I kill myself to no longer be bound to this unforgiving world. Its almost too good to be true but I guess thats a fair trade for my life.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I'm a shift worker and always forget to take my meds and then it turns into a depression spiral of not wanting to look after myself. Tips for building a healthy routine on a rotating roster.,"I work a rotating roster and my body clock is everywhere, so I don't really have a 'routine' which makes taking my meds at the correct time very difficult.  Sometimes I'll have a fleeting moment that I've forgotten to take them, but my brain quickly dismisses it as if it's not important.  I don't really know how to explain it.  Deep down I know how important it is that I take them, but something stops me from caring.  Thus starting the cycle of being chemically imbalanced and feeling 'unworthy' of being mentally well. I essentially need to ingrain it into a routine somehow so I just don't think about it and just take them.  

Long story short, I'm just seeking some tips with building a healthy routine so I can make this work.  There's plenty of advice out there for people who work the 9 to 5 grind, but I'm struggling to get some decent advice for someone who sometimes works nights, sometimes works days, weekends etc.  I've tried using phone apps, but they're mostly catered to 9-5 workers.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Two Depressed people in a relationship,"I’m really struggling and need some support right now.  

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately.  We’ve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness.  I tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression.  He, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed.

The depression started creeping up beginning of September.  At first it was subtle, and I was doing ok with dealing and understanding.  

But now, it’s manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end.  I can’t even joke around and be fun anymore, because I consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me.  I’m misfiring and crying uncontrollably.  And I’m constantly battling between my intellect and what I know (he’s depressed, it’s not a choice, he doesn’t mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when he’s withdrawn, etc.) and my anxiety monologue (something is wrong, because I am wrong, and he’s not telling me because he wants me to break up with him/hurt me).

The major difference between us is, I have a support system.  I have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that I use to keep me in check.  But lately, I can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being.

He says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist (though I know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past).

And it’s also screwed with our intimate side (which I think is a lot of the source of ire).  Sex is important, but my partner’s well being is of course more important.  I am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks he’s been so down, we can’t connect on that level.  I have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired.  A previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so I am on high alert.

"Ex GF was my life, now what's the point?","  

I posted my story on another sub for some support. Feel free to read it…it’s long. I am just feeling very depressed today. ""Depressed"" being an understatement. She was my world. We were going to get married and have a life together. Had our kids name picked out. She told me she couldn’t imagine her life without me. Now she’s posting pictures with the guy she cheated on me and left me for saying how amazing he is. He’s a loser, no job, no education, can’t support her. I would have given her the world. 

She doesn’t love me. She’ll never come back to me. What’s the point anymore? I don’t care about having a good job or having “a lot going for me”. The one thing I want in life I can’t have. Her. She was my everything. I don’t want someone else. I literally don’t care about anything in my life anymore. I hate everything. I hate myself. I lost her. I treated her so well but it just wasn’t enough. And now she’s gone. I don’t know what to do. I just wake up, go to work, go to the gym, go to bed and repeat. Every day is the same and my partner is now happy with someone else. What am I supposed to do? I feel broken.

Nothing makes me happy anymore,"This year has been pretty rough for me. I had complications with an IUD I had put in and needed surgery to remove it as Ithe doctor put it in wrong. I had a scare with mold damage to where I was living, I threw out a bunch of clothes and had to wash everything in hot. I had a scare with bed bugs and had to freeze everything and dry in hot. I broke up with my boyfriend because he didnt want to see me anymore. I have had a lot of health problems and the doctors think I might have something serious (I worry that its cancer). The only thing good going for me is my grades and thats because I literally put any energy I have that doesn't go towards aimlessly panicking and googling whatever my mind wants to worry over towards my grades.

Lately I am in a endless state of pain(due to my medical problems) and I just dont feel happy anymore. I remember two years ago when I was actually happy and I was able to laugh at things or feel content. I just feel weird. My days are lonely...I dont have a boyfriend, family, friends,pets. My family lives far away, I wish I saw them more...but im too poor to travel. I just leave the house to go to school, come home, take tylenol then study. I got a scholarship which should have made me happy but I just didnt feel anything. My first thought was actually ""well if I have cancer this scholarship wont really matter."" I keep thinking that im not going to live for very long. When people talk to me or try to make jokes I force a smile and it feels so weird because Im focusing on trying to look normal and happy so people cant see that im actually emotionless. How I am is starting to scare me a little bit like Im worried it might get worse. I tried seeing the school counseller but that didnt really help me as it made me uncomfortable talking about my anxiety.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Has anyone else experienced these symptoms?,"My depression has always been severe, and I experience most symptoms other than an increase in energy and appetite. The worst symptom I used to have was intense pain in my chest as if someone were trying to rip out my heart. However, I just had my worst depressive episode ever, and it lasted for about a month.

My symptoms were:

1. Feeling as if I weigh a ton, and have immense difficulty moving
2. Nausea
3. Aforementioned chest pain
4. Tunnel vision
5. Blacking out

Every time the sun went down, and sometimes during the day, these symptoms would occur simultaneously and in very high intensity at the drop of a hat. I never felt it coming, it was like a switch being flipped, and then I would suddenly be filled with the worst dread I had ever experienced and feel my head floating away from my body from the sheer intensity of the depression. 

I'm not necessarily looking for sympathy, I just need to know if anyone else has experienced this as I've never heard of depression getting this bad and am wondering if something else may be wrong.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation.,"*(tl;dr at the bottom)*

Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isn't one of them. But it is the problem of my now ex-boyfriend.  
He isn't someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but it's hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of ""I don't know"".  
So I thought I'd ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he can't (Of course I know that you can just make guesses but I'm trying really hard to understand him and I'm just so confused.)  
We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldn't say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when he's feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. That's why we're not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didn't see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks I'm feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. (Which I think is true and at the same time isn't... It's definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we weren't already there where I would like my relationship to be.)  
That was two months ago. We're still texting each day and sometimes meet - we're not having sex or kissing but still, he doesn't treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesn't want to. We're officially broken up... but we're not just friends.   
I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didn't think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this - although it seems that this didn't improve anything for him.   
He said he doesn't know what his feelings for me are but he doesn't want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend.  
I don't know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, he's doing nothing to improve his situation and I can't take this much longer.   
I know that most people - especially in the relationship subreddits...  -  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that I'm not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, I've talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that they're confused, too, and also think that his behavior isn't that of ""just a friend"".

And now, I'm still here because I've seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the break-up and what's standing between us aren't not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I don't just want to leave this awesome person behind because he's going through a hard time.  


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didn't sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesn't know what he feels for me but doesn't want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems - but isn't really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. I'm so confused and don't know what to think or how to help him.

So... I'm not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly I'm looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this.  
Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? Is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Feeling Lost,"I have Anxiety, PTSD, Bipolar Depression, Pulmonary Embolism, Obesity, and Mobility issues, and I am only 35/M/living in the Seattle Area.

No One Cares So Why Should I?,"I am not great with conveying my thoughts but I’ll try. I feel like no one cares whatsoever. All of my friends have others to hang out with, and honestly they probably enjoy each other more than being with me. 

On top of this, I don’t really know how to tell people I’m not doing well for a few reasons. I always seem to get short responses like “it’ll get better” or “Oh” and then it’s left at that. No one knows how to help me, which is fair I suppose, but after so many cries for help, I’ve given up. No one knows how to help and surely it must upset or annoy them hearing about me having a bad time, so I decided to lie. I don’t tell anyone how I’m really feeling except on rare occasions. Even then, it’s not usually helped. I’m so useless to everyone by being this way, so instead I’d rather put on a mask and fake happiness, that way no one has to bother.

I don’t care about myself, I just want others to be happy and if that means ignorance then that’s fine I suppose. I don’t think anyone should do this, but I don’t carry the same standards for myself as I do others. I’m sure it’ll be bad but I just don’t know what else I could do.

I wish I could just be better but it’s impossible. Everything hurts in my heart so much that sometimes it makes me nauseous. I can’t stand living around people who barely notice me. I allow myself to get used to make others happy. I hate it, but I’ve decided it’s logical if it makes others happy. Instead of two people hurting, I just do, all the time. In this sense, I’m like a doll. I’m used for whatever purpose and then discarded afterwards. It hurts so bad, but I don’t know anything else. 

I’m worried about asking for help since I feel like I disappoint others when I can’t tell them what’s wrong, or if what they say or suggest doesn’t help. I don’t know what I need honestly.

"I don't know what to do, and I feel like i'm drowning","I am done with all of this.

"My mother and I had an unsettling conversation in the midst of my depression, and I don't know how to feel...","Okay, so I am teen (14M) who is dealing with a lot of struggles. I have had depression for months, and I don't know what to do. I live in a smal part of a big town, which means I don't see many friends often, and I'm the only one my age in that part of town. That's bad from a start, but that's not what's triggering me...

I had been dealing with my dumbass psycho ex, not able to see my gf, being bullied and cyberbullied. I have beaten myself until I bled, every day in the past 2 weeks, and I always wonder if life is worth living, and yet I still try to piece things together again. 

Yesterday, I had figured out that my past was a lot worse than I had originally thought, with reoccurring memories of childhood trauma. We were having a normal conversation about how I was doing at school (as usual), but it took a turn quickly back to the worst childhood memories I had, which all I had forgotten until then. I had thought it was always peaceful back then since almost every childhood memory I had before then was happy. I even bring up these positive memories whenever I'm down. And these memories came back. Here's what they were one by one in the order they happened:

The first memory, the only one I couldn't regain my perception on was one from when I was in preschool (obviously). The last day I went to preschool, my mother was watching in the preschool because she noticed things weren't perfectly fine there. Before it was over, a little girl who was 3 years of age, opened one of the metal doors and accidentally slammed her fingers in the doors. The tips of 3 of that girl's fingers were cut off from that door and was bleeding everywhere. The staff was panicking, but they weren't doing anything. They didn't call for help. They just stood and watched. The staff, also, were both 17 year-olds watching over 32 preschool kids (which was illegal). My mother quickly took me out of that daycare and felt so bad for leaving me there. I've always remembered preschool, but I've never known what actually happened in that building. After that event, the teens were arrested, and since today, that building had been shut down for 11 years.

The next one, the first one I recall, was when I was in elementary school. I was in kindergarten, and the teachers were very strict, and they had the worst principal I had ever seen. He had beaten, tortured, and yelled at many kids, including me. I was once beaten, dragged to the office, and tied to a chair for the rest of the day in my kindergarten year. My mother was pissed off as the school when she saw my bruise marks. When I heard this happened to me, I remembered and regained my perspective on that moment, and two others I now recall. 

Another time I remember that was mentioned to me was in that same school in about first or second grade. This one kid would bully me over and over, and he would beat on me if he ever caught up to me, and the teachers just let him. One day, I thought I had put up with this crap far too much and was beating that kid's ass. It took four teachers to pull me off him. They told my mother to immediately come to the school for my ""actions"", and she took me out for ice cream for standing up for myself, and we were pissed off about how the teachers just let bad things happen to kids at that elementary school. 

The last memory I remember was in that same year in that same elementary school. One time, I feel off the top of the slide in the playground and busted my head open on the pavement. I was bleeding everywhere, and I now remember how bad it felt. The teachers were just again, standing there. Not even helping, not even calling for emergency services. Just watching. They didn't even call my mother. Apparently, their logic was if I was ""disrespectful"", they would call my mother like 22 times, but if I was injured, bleeding, and crying out in pain, they wouldn't give a shit! 

I've never wanted to know about this, and now I have other bad memories I probably won't forget soon, even though I want to. To recap, I have have learned something I never wanted to about my past during depression, and now it's even worse. I've tried so hard to keep my life going in the right direction, but every time I try...it seems to get worse...

Today, I'm going to try a new way of doing things. Instead of deleting my ex's requests and messages, I'll ignore her. Instead of being afraid and nervous, I'll send my gf a letter today, and I'll see how it goes. Instead of letting bullying weaken me, I will deal with it in a better fashion. I'll even report it everything. This was the advice I had been given, and I thank my friends on Reddit for helping me. It'll be a while, and I will struggle and sadden on the way, but I'll try...

I still feel horrible on the inside and outside, but I'll try as hard as I can to be happy again. I don't know. What do you think I should do?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm fed up,"I take my meds, I go to therapy, but nothing is sticking. I do everything right but I keep failing again, and again. I know I need to get out of my own head. I know I need to break out of this unhealthy way of thinking, but my brain just won't do it! I hate how I come across as lazy. I'm exhausted. 

This is my third attempt at trying to get my Bachelors. I only have a semseter left. Each time I try to graduate, something horrible happens, I get hospitalized for suicide, I get assaulted, and my mother dies. Now I'm constantly bracing myself for more suffering, and I end up creating it by panicking instead of doing my assignments. I'm making this harder on myself then it has to be. 

I feel guilt for being a financial burden on my father, I feel shame for not moving on with my life like my peers. I hate not having friends, and being a hermit. I really don't want to move back in with my father, because he hoards, and my depression will only get worse. All I want to be is financially independent. I want to be a functioning member of society. 

It's also been a struggle to get my ADHD meds, I'm a mess, and can't keep events straight. I got the date wrong yet again. I keep sleeping the day away. It took all my effort to put on jeans, and cook myself breakfast this morning. One load of dishes and I'm exhausted. I'm sick of it!

I'm ruining my own life but I can't stop.,"I'm 20 and in my junior year of college. I was re-diagnosed this year with dysthymia (used to be major depression) and started Prozac, which basically just gave me mild side effects and didn't help at all. I switched to Wellbutrin and didn't even have any side effects, I felt like I was taking a sugar pill in the morning because it also didn't help at all. I start Effexor tomorrow and am setting up counseling, but I'm literally ruining my life right now.

In past semesters, I was able to scrape through with a B average and go to most of my classes. That's not the case anymore. I'm not getting out of bed until the sun goes down, I'm skipping days of classes at a time, I have no idea what any of my grades are - and the worst part is that I can't even bring myself to care. Somewhere in the back of my mind I KNOW that if I fail this semester I'm going to majorly fuck up my financial aid and won't graduate on time, but it just doesn't matter to me. I'm too tired to care.

I barely wake up in time for work most days, and I'm having to make excuses for being late all the time. I don't cook, so I don't eat. I don't clean, so my room and kitchen are disgusting. I don't even know what homework assignments I need to catch up on. I'm exhausted all the time. I'm too tired to even read over this before posting, so sorry in advance if none of it makes sense.

Basically I'm halfway through this semester and I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail all of my classes, ruin my financial aid, get fired from my job, get written up by housing (I live on campus), and I'm worried about what I might do to myself if this all happens. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know how to make myself care. I don't know how to get motivated to get out of bed in the morning. I will accept literally any advice from anyone.

My relationship is imploding in on itself due to my depression...,"Long story short, I'm a twice divorced single father to a 3 year old boy and I'm a Staff Sergeant in the AirForce which I've served the past 10 years. I've been battling depression my entire career. Mostly due to trama of a neglectful and abusive childhood and made worse by divorces that followed. I've been in and out of therapy for years. Now I am dating a wonderful woman who now live with me and mothers my son like he's her own. She also has a 5 year old daughter and when we first got together she was 2 months pregnant and we now have a beautiful new daughter. I have a new job in the Air Force as a Avionics Fundamentals Instructor and I love it. Ever with all this good happening in my life my depression is surging back. One of the biggest issues that its bringing is its completely destroyed my sex drive and I just don't have the urge for it in any form. So this is causing my girlfriend to feel very rejected even though she know why I'm simple not interested in it. Don't get me wrong, I'm still very attracted to her, she's absolutely gorgeous lol I just don't have any libido. But this accidental rejection is causing a huge divide between us and I'm scared of losing her and my new daughters. I'm starting up therapy again and seeking to get put on antidepressants again and I know it will help but I'm worried I'll lose everything before I'm back to my normal self.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

My insecurities are everyone’s plaything.,"I’ve been through a lot and it’s insanely diffcult to open up about them, so it seems to family I act the way I do just because I chose to. 

I’m constantly being made fun of for not doing certain things and I get really offended and uncomfortable. I prefer not to share what, but I usually tell them to quit it, yet they’re always like “it’s a joke” or “you’re so over dramatic/buzz kill”. Now I don’t ever say anything because now I have the reputation of being the “negative Nancy” of every social event. 

I even have a certain family member who pry into my business cause they want to know my secrets. Why isn’t boundaries a thing anymore? Sometimes I think to myself I should just blurt out what I’ve been through just to have a greater chance of letting them leave me alone, but it’s scary and personal. I can’t even write them in a journal, to my past therapist (who I saw for six months), or friends I trust. I hate myself everyday for always keeping things in. I’m a coward. 

I feel trapped in my mind. Always telling myself to forget, but think about it everyday anyways. What do I do to change? How can I escape this constant degradation from people?

I am nothing anymore,"So I have been depressed all of my life as long as I can remember. I didn't really know what its like to not have that sinking, dreadful feeling in my heart. That is -until I met my current boyfriend. He makes me feel alive and happy again. He pulled me out of the darkness I was so deep in. But I can feel myself starting to slip again, and I'm trying so hard to not let it drag me down. I used to self harm, and I promised him I'd try as hard as I could to not do it again. For like 3 weeks before the present one, I was completely absolutely numb. I didn't laugh, didn't cry, didn't feel anything at all. It was the worst feeling in my life, It felt like I just died and had no soul or heartbeat, but worse. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through it again. But after about three weeks of feeling that way, I self-harmed, partially to prove I could still feel something. And for some reason, I didn't feel the sadness I usually do when I relapse. I just felt *alive*. And I slipped out of that terrible numb feeling. I feel alive now, and still numb, but not as bad as before. But the problem is, I've slipped into a different type of numbness. It's like I don't care about anything anymore. I have 3 grades below a 50, and I really don't have the energy or motivation to care, even though I want to. I honestly wouldn't care If i just got hit by a truck or like had a heart attack, but its not like i'm gonna go out of my way to make it happen.

My partners depression gets extremely bad she is constantly sad and frequently has suicidle thoughts and gets very overwhelmed with her home life has asthma attacks and panic attacks for apparently no reason. I am running out of ideas i have done everything for her and i am continuing to do so but my mental illnesses sometimes makes it almost impossible to help and vise versa. She had said many times she wants to get better so bad and get out of her house when shes 18 so we can get engaged but she says she cant see a way out i have alot of experience with helping people out of suicide but the longer this goes on the worse i feel about how good of a job i do with her i used to feel very good about our phone conversations because my advice was always perfect she would go from a full blown panic attack anxiety attack to laughing with me making jokes and talking about all the things we were going to do in the future and how to achieve our goals now it seems like they end in her not actually feeling better just acting better or pushing the thoughts away.

Girlfriend left me and now I'm terrified my depression/anxiety will overwhelm me,"Hello,

Today my girlfriend decided we will no longer be together. Or I don't even know how to put it. Throughout our relationship I believe my anxiety made me insecure and at times it got to the point where I would tell her that I don't think I want to be in a relationship with her. To me they were always empty words in what I'm now thinking was a cry out for help but seeing it through her eyes, why wouldn't she believe me, and why wouldn't this effect her. It would have a terrible effect on me. And about a week ago I said it again, and that was the last straw for her.

So here I am, alone. I've never really had many friends and never reached out to make some because she was my best friend. I've battled anxiety and depression for a while now but don't know how to cope with what has happened. While I have talked to a psychologist before this girl was the only one who I truly felt free speaking with and has helped me tremendously through the years.

My anxiety has a bad effect on my body and I'm so scared I'm going to throw away my new job that I love, and the great opportunities I have because I just can't bother to get up and go out the door.

I don't know what to do.  I just want the girl I've loved for so long.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a College Student Struggling with Depression,"I've been struggling with depression for years.  I'm hoping to graduate in the spring, but I won't if I don't get myself back into shape.  Last year wasn't so bad, but it's really hit me hard this semester.  I had to withdraw from a class and am behind in all my others.  I keep making lists of the things I need to do and try to take them one at a time, but since I've missed so much class and everything is already going to be penalized for being late, I feel like it's becoming impossible.  Getting help right now isn't really an option.  I was supposed to get a scholarship this year but it's delayed because of some confusing financial thing, so I'm out of cash.  I don't have enough for even one copay, or pay for transportation to see a psychologist.   Professors are emailing me about assignments and I've been giving excuses for months.  The school won't give me accommodations because my diagnosis is too old.  I don't get financial or emotional support from my family so that's out.   All I can do is try to go to class and do the work, which makes it all the more stressful.   I feel like I'm always loosing time and never making progress.

Opening up,"Hiya! So I'm a student at uni and I find it really hard to stay motivated to go to class/do anything most of the time. I hate that I feel that way, I was pretty depressed a few years back and now I feel like I might be relapsing in a way. The thing is though, my dad's coming to see me in a few days, so he's going to be able to tell that I haven't been that great. Usually when people come to visit me I try to hide all evidence of depression (unwashed dishes, clothes everywhere, general messiness) almost like an addict would hide their evidence. But now I don't even have the energy for that anymore. I'm thinking of just admitting to my dad that I'm not that well, but I know that would break both my parents' heart. I just want them to be proud of me and I feel like right now I'm not someone anyone could be proud of. I want to be able to function on my own and do great things but apparently I'm not capable of that. Anyway my point is: Should I be completely open with my parents about how I've been feeling? Even though I know they'll be incredibly worried about me and maybe even disappointed? Should I start therapy again and never talk about depression with anyone else but a therapist?

venting because i need to (somewhat nsfw based on this sub's rules),recently ive just been drinking to feel something because im numb to my depression but its to the point where my drinking makes me brutally aware of my depression. i cant use drinking or drugs to help me feel anything anymore. i shouldnt have in the first place. but im at a point where i want to go to self harm to feel something. even if its a created feeling that lasts a couple of moments. and ik at some point that wont help anymore and ill become helplessly numb. and im coming to the feelings of suicide like theres no point. when im happy its amazing but it comes down in a crash and all the sudden im just absolutely numb again. and i used to do a lot of art but even that doesnt help anymore and ive lost interest in everything.,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
My friend is suffering from severe depression and I want to help her but I'm not sure how,"I (17m) moved to Houston from Toronto last January and I have kept in contact with one of my friends in Toronto (17f) who is clearly struggling with her mental health. We stay in contact over snapchat and she's opened up to me a few times and I've tried to be as supportive as possible. The last snap I got from her she said something about how she's ""not sure she can make it through the next couple weeks."" I've never experienced any mental health struggles as severe as what she is going through so I don't think I'm in a great place to give advice. I've tried to just listen to her and be supportive so far but it doesn't seem to be helping her much. The physical distance between us makes it even harder for me to see how she's doing as I don't get to see her at school on an everyday basis like I used to. What I can I do to best help her without being pushy? And are there any resources that I could/should reccomend to her?
Any and all help is greatly appreciated.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Am I pathetic?,"I moved 1,000 miles away from my hometown to live with my boyfriend a year ago and I’ve been miserable since. I love my boyfriend with everything in me, but I have a very, very close relationship with my family and the distance is killing me. I practically raised my sister (there’s a 10 year age gap), so I feel like I abandoned my child or something, even though she’s old enough to be more of my friend now. I miss living in a very small town (I live in Miami now), and just being close to everyone. My relationships with my family are slipping and it makes me hate my life.

My boyfriend refuses to live anywhere that isn’t urban especially somewhere as rural and “uncultured” as my home, and there’s no cities within a 4 hour distance from my hometown, which wouldn’t help at all. Idk what to do, I can’t imagine my life without my boyfriend, but I can’t imagine living like this without my family near me for much long either.

Am I pathetic for being so close to my family and not having the strength to put effort into building a life separate from them? I just see so many people who live close to their parents/siblings (even my boyfriend) and get soooo jealous, but every advice subreddit seems to think I’m being unreasonable and not trying hard enough to live here.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is this a symptom of depression?,"Let's say that you want to do or change something in your life. A new hobby, learn a new skill etc. You know how to get started... but you never actually do it. You lack the energy and the motivation to start or keep going even though it is something you like and know it would improve your life. But you end up just fantasizing about it and not actually do it.

If it is a symptom of depression, then I have been suffering from it without my knowledge for almost 5 years. I thought I was just lazy. There are so many things I want to do and learn that are in the realm of possibility, but I never do them. For the past 5 years I've been on autopilot about this because I thought that was just how I am. But apparently it's depression holding me back?

There has been stuff this year that I've suspected is the cause of why I feel sad all the time, but I never knew not doing what you want to do is a symptom too. If it's true then I have missed a large part of my life to depression without knowing about it. I'm 20 now so it started when I

This is gross but I really need help,"I've just woken up from a months long depression hole today. I was getting presentable, going to work and taking care of my cat but that's pretty much it.

Hey.,"Hi. I wanted to reach out. To have a genuine interaction with another person. No pretenses or ulterior motives. Im on the balcony of a hotel in Thailand and looking out at that long drop, it just makes me wonder what if. I don't know if I've ever felt as lost as I do tonight.

In my cynicism I fear that people don't actually genuinely care(for others, me included), and why would they eh? Does that kind of warmth and love exist in the world outside of fairytales and movies? I have these doubts so I really don't reach out usually, even to the people I surround myself with. But right now maybe Im chasing rainbows again, but I'd like some genuine communication, even if it's on the internet and under the mask of anonymity. If anyone would care. If you would take the time to hear me.

I'm 22. I live in South Korea and I've been quite sad, depressed, since the 9th grade. It's been 8 years. I feel like I've lost a lot of what made me me in that time. I feel like an empty shell. All the color and life sucked out and nothing but an empty husk left. Yet despite all that I've lost, I believe I have much more to lose still, because I have despaired before, believing I've hit rock bottom. Then time would pass and I'd look back, only to realize how much I had back then.

When I first started to have depressing thoughts, self doubt, existential problems, I turned to my family for help. My mother, father and sister. Why? because they're my family, and I thought it would matter to them that I, their son, was suffering so genuinely, in so much pain and doubt. When I was so lost and confused and desperately reaching out to them, they fucking turned their back on me. Or so I felt, back then and I still do. I felt so betrayed that the people I loved and trusted the most in the world would do that so I became bitter and made a promise to myself that I'd never share my life with them again. I acted out, maybe in an attempt to punish them, to get back at them for not caring. I just let myself go, let my life collapse little by little. Years have passed now and I honestly think I've never been able to really give up hope that my family would be there for me, as if they would just suddenly drop whatever they're doing and come to my side, telling me that they care and that we'll  make this right. Now, as much it pains me to acknowledge it, I don't  think that's  ever going to happen. I just attempted to talk to my mother for the first time in months about my depression and she immediately got up and left the room. I feel like I should be undamaged by this by now, and I want to tell myself I'm fine after that, but I feel so alone in this world and stupid for thinking that she'd care enough to want to listen. This is all the more crushing because we're  on a family trip which I did not want to come to initially, but after we got here, I felt things that I hadn't  felt for a long time, that I thought I'd never feel again. Something made me want to get my life together and do things. So in the process of thinking about what I'd like to do after this trip, the events I mentioned happened. I honestly feel very hopeless and my will to live has dwindled close to none. Should I just give up on my seemingly unrealistic dreams and expectations of a loving caring family and move on? It hurts my heart. so much. but seems like the only way to do anything with my life. Do I move on? for what? Myself? It just doesn't seem a good enough reason. I am not a good enough reason for me to continue living life. I don't care about myself enough. A life without love seems bleak, ugly and meaningless.

 I'm thinking of packing my bags and getting on a plane to like canada or australia to start a new life. With zero plans, it scares me so much, but I want to stop this endless ride downhill. Despite the despair in this post, what I really seek is a reason to continue and a way to do so. How do I move forward?

I need help to help a friend...,"I have a friend (teenager), he is good at anything specifically, he doesnt have hobbies, nor does he have anything he wants to do... and naturally depression kicked in, noone noticed for a while, I personally found out about it being serious just about... 3, maybe 4? hours ago... he sent me a message saying ""bye, im suiciding"" which on its own, with no context, seemed as a stupid stupid joke... so naturally I said that this isn't a topic to joke about, and eventually put some things together: He doesnt have hobbies / goals, He smokes (recently started which is horrible imo), he drinks , and he was known to have been overly depressed before, but nothing came out of it, it seemed like he had a rougher time with small things, I started to get worried so I digged deeper... talked with a few common friends and only 1 was able to be of help, the friend (suicidal) had plans... everything. step. by. step. It was actually pretty .... yikes idk... scary, and I got to talk with him, explained to him as nice as one could, that he needs, and he agreed, and said, what about telling your parents? they sure will helped. what followed had me mute. litterarly. HE DID! and his dad is an alchoolic that doesnt care, overall a cool guy to have a drink with and have some fun talk, but not a dad. for sure not. and his mother seemed really active and protective, which she isn't... he told his mom about his issues, and she said: ""well you better get on studying and stop with this (bad word) poopoo"" . Which pretty much dug him even further into the hole he is in, I can't help but want to do something, I wont be telling his parents more because I am afraid that he will be punished for speaking his problems out loud, which is wrong, but keeping in mind his parents, not surprising, anything I can do for him?!? I really quite do need this help as I have never been... sad... I've never felt actual sadness... I've felt defeat, anger, pitty, but not sad.

I’ve broken a year long streak of not cutting and now I can’t stop (long post I’m sorry),"It’s just about two months until my eighteenth birthday. I’ve been having these terrible thoughts for almost as long as I could remember. It just started out as this awful feeling and it’s evolved into daily thoughts of suicide, non-existent self confidence, what can only be described as extreme social anxiety, a constant feeling of loneliness, and self hatred. 

About two years ago I started cutting. I don’t know why i started but i did it for almost a year. It took the pain away emotionally and made it all physical. It became something I could see and touch not just this oppressive darkness I feel on a constant basis. I knew it was an awful habit so I tried my best to stop. About three or four weeks ago things got really bad and I did it again. And now I’m back to square one.

I don’t have anyone to talk to because my parents would send me to a hospital, my friends would stop talking to me, I have no significant other to share my thoughts with because I am completely unlikable and extremely awkward around other people, and my therapist refuses to do anything about anything I tell him.

Every time my brain makes things bad I do it again and again and part of me wants to stop because i know it’s not good but at the same time I really don’t want to because in some messed up way it makes things feel better. I feel trapped in my own mind and I don’t really know what to do anymore.

Still on the fence,"For a long while now I have been depressed and haven't really had many close friend and for a little bit hitting a point of literally just 1 semi close online friend and no body else at all, but that's besides the point. For the last probably month or 2 I have been on the fence (or just cant decide) on what to do with one side being just live a happy life with a tightly knit group of girl and maybe online friends with possibly even a relationship and the other side being suicide. For the longest time I've been leaning back and forth and thanks to friends I'm feeling better some time but thanks to school and alot of punishments and groundings every so often and fairly recently having moved between states pushing me the other way. I'm not sure if this is just me or amazingly common but I just don't know what to do any more and I want to be able to land on the right side of the fence on my feet and not fall back into a pit (sorry if it's an odd analogy). I just really don't know what to do since the only people who ever really reach out to me are semi close friends and just some school mates ending nonsense. All I do if sit around mostly unmotivated to make a difference and better things for myself by simple even doing homework but instead I feel like a lazy bum who uses his only bit of motivation to ask a handful of friends how their day was when I see them only but still feel like I'm just pestering them. I mean it's been almost half the school year now and the only person who sits next to me because they want to and not because their entire group moved to where I sit is my semi close friend I mention earlier. I've got nearly no friends, got near nonexistant privacy, no motivation, and the only 2 things that I can always look back on for a reason to keep going are I'm my dad only child and he put 15 years of effort into making my last this long and just the simple question of how can I do it quick without it hurting too much or looking a fool.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I don't know if this has any logic, but I think I have daytime depression and anxiety","I'm in an unusual situation.

Prozac

Prozac + Xanax

Lexapro

Lexapro + Wellbutrin

Lexapro + Wellbutrin + Remeron

Wellbutrin

Tianeptine

Effexor

Seroquel

I've tried a few racetams (Piracetam, Pramiracetam, and Noopept)

Modafinil

My doctor tried to put me on bipolar meds (Seroquel). It didn't work, but I had a weird reaction, I was on 300mg before bedtime, but it didn't make me sleepy at all, it only gave me a stuffed nose, it was impossible to breathe through my nose without Olynth.

I don't know if this makes any sense, my doctor(s) told me that I'm a conundrum.

I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless,"First time poster here. On mobile.

I've known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating.

This guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dad's side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dad's mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo.
Things weren't always perfect.

I nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan.
This year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse.

I tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him.
On the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well.
Then on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky.
He said he didn't love me anymore.
He finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didn't realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didn't know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.
He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. 
In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didn't love me? It wasn't logical.
We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me.
Fine.

I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day.
We didn't end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday.
We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant.

Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know.
Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together.
We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination.  While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didn't want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me.
After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together.

The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for.
We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. We decided to stay and just wait it out.

During this time I noticed he was texting someone a lot. I read the name and realized it wasn't someone I was familiar with. I clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack I asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. He told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. I wasn't buying it. We went through the concert. Went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the Airbnb.
I didn't want to be the fool so I did what needed to be done where I could get answers. I looked through his phone. Sure enough, he was talking to someone else. I didn't know how to handle the situation but I knew I needed to make aware the other party of my presence. I told them who I was, how long I've known him, and the status we were in. I then added them on Snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that I wasn't lying and that I wasn't just anyone.

As soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. That if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly.
I ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadn't been dating me since August.

He wouldn't speak to me and he wouldn't care to admit that he was a liar and cheater.
He decided he would be taking an Uber to the bus station because he couldn't stand being with me. It didn't work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me.
Once we got closer I confronted him. I couldn't keep in what I was thinking and wanted to let him know what I felt. It sucked.
He said he hadn't loved me for a while.
That when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie.
Through all this I couldn't get him to see that he had lied and cheated.
We argued the rest of the way home.
At the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldn't have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road.
I ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back.

Since I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off.

And so now I'm just here. Feeling worthless.
I cared for him
I loved him.
But I didn't even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better.
He didn't even have a regard for me anymore. He didn't even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so I've been writing this since 5:23 AM and now it's 6:29 AM. I don't know how to feel. But I feel worthless.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
What can I do to stop being a weirdo?,"A lot of people have called me a weirdo and I know why. 
I laugh really loudly (it's super obnoxious and I think I do it because I'm an attention seeker and it make it seem like what my friend and I are talking about a lot funnier that it actually is because I want people to think I'm funny). I also laugh at jokes even if they're not funny (because it's less awkward than sitting there in silence and not knowing what to say)
I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents (again, it might be because I want people to think I'm funny)
I don't think before I speak. I start a sentence and then I stop because then I realise I shouldn't say something. It's like my brain's delayed. I begin to say something and then I tell them to ignore me (I think my brain's on autopilot all the time and I don't think)
I constantly stare at people and make eye contact with them (which is just weird, it's also creepy) 
Sometimes when I speak super fast, I end up speaking gibberish and no one knows what I'm saying (again, it might be because I don't think before I speak)
I make weird, sharp movements (because I'm thinking out loud and I forget that I'm not alone)
I make weird sounds in general (I don't know if it's because I'm so bored and I need to keep myself busy or if I'm a psychopath)
I fidget a lot and I can't keep my hands to myself 
I don't know if it's because I feel so out of place or if it's because I feel so uncomfortable all the time and that's why I do all of these things. I just feel so strange and I agree with people when they call me a weirdo (even though I hate to admit it)
I feel so on edge all the time and I don't know how to calm myself down. I'm so hyper all the time. But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like I'm boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo (it's a never ending cycle)
I'm constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like I'm talking to myself (which is super embarrassing). Daydreaming takes my mind off of everything, but it's super depressing when I stop and I come back to reality (I'm a lot better now and I don't daydream as much)
I constantly feel like I'm under so much pressure 
I'm not feminine in any way. I don't care of my appearance and I smell (but I just don't feel like taking care of myself, I know it's a crappy excuse). I feel so masculine and I hate it. I love being a girl, but I don't know why I can't bring myself to act like one. I sit like a man too. 
As weird as it sounds, I feel like I'm watching myself play a character. Almost as if I'm not allowing myself to be my true self because I think I'm boring. I don't know why I can't allow myself to slow down. 
I'm always rushing myself and I have to do everything at an unusually fast pace. I'm so erratic with everything, whether it be me talking to someone or walking. I don't know what to do about this. 
I don't know if it's because my family have always called me insane and as an act of rebellion, maybe I'm acting like that because I believe it too. 
I don't think I'm insane but, maybe I'm wrong?
It's driving people away and it's driving me insane. 
I'm not aware of my surroundings and it really pisses people off, including myself. 
I really need some advice and I want to know why I'm acting like this and what I need to do to be a better person.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

How will I ever know if I’m well enough for a relationship?,"I’ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember and suicidal thoughts for the past ~4 years (they started around the time I was about to enter uni). One thing that I have always believed is that, before I even consider any sort of romatic relationship, I need to work on bettering my mental health drastically and thus gain enough emotional maturity. However, I’ve failed to define how much emotionally maturity is just enough for me to start considering myself worthy of a relationship. 

Thanks to a supportive family, medication and plenty of therapy, I’ve bettered myself far beyond what I thought I was capable of. I haven’t had serious suicidal thoughts in a couple of months and I’ve been able to confront situations which before would’ve emotionally crippled me for weeks. I still have a lot to work on, specially in terms of social skills, but atleast I can find some joy in my day to day life.

So my question is: how will I ever know when I’ll be mentally stable enough for me to even consider seeking a relationship? Or am I just overthinking all of this?

Is this a toxic friend,"I am a shy and private person. Thus as s result i don't have a lot of friends, for a year and half i have been friend with s girl of my sm age (i am 19y m). I was really happy to get a friend like her she was supportive and caring but for the past six moths i have noticed that she was not replying to my text , tbh i thought it was fine and thought because of the semester. (We are classmates). I have noticed that she only act Friendly when she need to. I thought it was also fine as she may be nervous to ask for favours but for a past month i have noticed that she completely stop texted me (just a few days ago she asked about our friendship beyond college). This seems very suspicious. I don't know what have gone wrong. I see her as my friend still. It's okay to break friendship if one party thinks it. The problem lies whenever i ask if she wants to stop me texting she don't reply but actually tries to avoid it. I have now seen it was a weak spot for me. She was my only friend and i am not open to my family. Now because of this my concentration and mental stability is gone (i suffer from schizophrenia). I don't know if what happening is real or i am making the stuff up. Anyway despite of knowing everything she is not coming clean. I suspect she don't want me be her friend anymore (and it's fine,) but she is not telling me that because of the help ,/ benifit.

I have a really hard time getting myself to do basic things like make food for myself or apply for jobs how do I overcome this?,"Ive struggled with this kind of depression on and off for a couple years I know that I'm not just a lazy person because I have been able to work very very hard at things in the past but I have been unemployed since halloween and I am having real trouble doing even the basics. I am living with my parents at the moment and they have been beyond amazing to me and I really really want to just get a job and stop being a burden on them but for some reason I really have trouble getting myself to stop procrastinating and I've only applied to like 10 jobs since I quit my last job a month ago (It was a horrible job so I do not regret quiting). I rarely make food for myself which causes me to lose weight and I was already underweight before I became unemployed. I feel so ashamed of myself, every time I start to do something productive I start to worry I'm going to do it wrong and so I stop doing it then I feel worse and go procrastinate on reddit so I feel better for .02 seconds then I feel worse for procrastinating.

I can't remember the last time I showered or the last time I washed my hair - I think I did leave the house 2 days ago to get food?

am i depressed or just overthinking?,"im 15, and it all started 3 years ago, back then o used to live with my dad with my step mum and my half brothers and my mum as well, but my dad would tread me badly. he abused me physically, emotionally, and sexually. but i don’t want to go deeper into those parts. everyday after school he would always get mad at me for not ‘studying’ i mean i did get pretty wacky grades back then but still, how could i stay motivated if even my own father brings me down? he would hit me if i get the wrong answers and say bad stuff. i remember this one time when we had dinner, my step mum was there and we were all eating in silence, i could remember that day like it was yesterday. he asked me if i did my homework and i just didn’t answer, he then started yelling at me and he told that i don’t deserve anything good in this world. i didn’t know what to do that time, i sat there crying in the dinner table while my step mum looked at me with pity. she couldn’t do anything and that’s alright, i understood why. after dinner i ran to my room and i started cutting that day. after a few months my mum, brother, and i went back to my mums home country, i thought everything would be fine by then but i was wrong, 2 years ago i had no friends. i was lonely as heck. i have nobody to talk to. nobody to vent out to. last year i got some friends, but they weren’t the friends i really wanted. they kind of treated me like shit. and my aunt always gets mad at me for no reason, she tells me to go back to my father and it triggers me every time. she doesn’t know what he did, and maybe if she did, will she change? a few days ago i had a huge fight with her. i cried and told her how i felt with the way she was treating me. but she didn’t care.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I’m done.,"I’m done.

I don’t know why today is the day that broke the camels back, but I feel like bursting into tears. By all standards my life should be great. Loving parents, amazing spouse, Good in-laws, good paying job, nice new home, stable friends, and no major health problems. But I just sit here and writhe in emotional pain, I feel like driving my truck into a concrete barrier. 

I’m an adult. What could I possibly be sad about?

I tell people around me I don’t feel right, like how I’m abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. Everyone dismisses me. Not a rude way but, in a manner like “hey man we all feel that way sometimes.” My loved ones around me feels so needy, like if I were to hand off an ounce of my pain it would shatter them. I sit here and smile, do my best to join in on the conversation and not draw undue attention to myself.

My day to day job is being a Doctor, I get to help people and it makes me feel like I have purpose. But it’s not enough. I try to save money, not spend too much on myself, donate to others. But it’s not enough. I try to enjoy little hobbies, get outside, play with my dog, spend time with my friends.  But it’s not enough. 

I still feel sad.

I reach out on forums for depression and ask “do I have a problem?” “Is it normal to feel this way?” And not even the masses have comments for me. I don’t want to commit suicide because I would feel too responsible for the pain and mess I left behind. But if I was told tomorrow is my last day, I don’t think I would fight it much. I feel like help only comes if you do something dramatic. It makes me appreciate how brave people are for reaching out for help. Posting this is the best I can do.

Am I depressed? (SERIOUS),"I made this reddit because I do not know where else to go. I have not been the man that I used to be and it is tearing me apart. I have been tired all the time, lack of a will to eat (I would previously binge eat but now I don't want to eat anything), I don't wanna talk to anyone and I stay secluded in my room all day, I am irrationally anxious (especially around intimacy),  I lash out at people, and finally I don't have any motivation whatsoever to do my schoolwork or job. I come from a traditional Hispanic household and I can't really bring up these things because I have to be ""more of a man"". 

Yesterday I blew up at my girlfriend of a year and I was so mean that we nearly broke up. This is not normal and I never used to be this way, I mentioned how I might be depressed and honestly that's the only thing that has held us together, but she does not want to talk to me, rightfully so, and I have zero desire to do anything especially with the amount of guilt I have for mistreating her the way that I did.

my LDR boyfriend admitted he has depression and wants a break because of it,"for context, my boyfriend and I are in an ldr for over 1.5 years now. he's from japan and i'm from america. depression/mental illness are very much taboo, as is even things like therapy, in japan. it's just not something that's socially acceptable to even talk about there, so i can't imagine how hard it must be for him now.

we've never had any major fights/disagreements until this ""confrontation"" happened on thanksgiving day. he has been studying abroad in europe for the semester, and it's definitely taken a toll on him-- he knows and admits that this is one of the major reasons he is feeling the way he is now. he's homesick, doesn't have any close friends, and has recently found out one of his best friends from high school is addicted to drugs. overall.... it's been a really crazy semester for him, and lots of shitty things happening in my personal life as well. it's just not a good year for either of us, but our relationship has been really strong. 

i had just booked a non-refundable flight to visit him for christmas, my birthday, and through to new years. i noticed that, compared to when we discussed this visit during our last time together (\~1st week of november), he was significantly less excited. i knew something was off, but he wouldn't say. this weird vibe kept persisting through the week, and on thanksgiving night, i asked him what was wrong. he finally admitted to me (paraphrasing):

""i don't think i can love you anymore. not because i love someone else or lost interest in you, but i'm feeling really depressed recently, and i can't enjoy things. i can't even be excited for your visit. now, i'm just needing a break. I’m not saying I wanna cut you off completely, but at this moment idk how to even talk to you. what I’m doing is not giving up, but cleaning myself up. i just need time."" he keeps saying things like this, which is hard for me to accept because I know what it's like to be depressed. he is pushing me away and hiding this part of himself from me, and I just want nothing more than to support him and be there for him-- which made me feel like my visit was even more urgent.

he kept saying things like how he would feel sorry for me if i tried to stay by his side and support him, and how he doesn't want to burden me with his problems or ruin my bday/christmas/new years by making me sad. he even said, verbatim ""The more you care about me, the more I feel bad for you, regardless of what you’re saying. I might change my mind later but for now I can’t. When I see you care about me, I get hurt."" he even offered to pay for my flight because I ""shouldn't just come there to take care of someone who's full of shit"" since I can't get a refund, but I refused. 

It's been about two days, and at the end of our messaging and phone calls, I told him that I am still going to catch that flight, and that I'll give him the space he's asking for, but that I'm here whenever he needs me. 

sorry if it's hard to read, and no tl;dr because I think it's important to know everything that I wrote above before saying anything...

I'm just really desperate to talk to someone about this, and I really do need advice/support. 

How can I support him, aside from giving him space? Should I wait for him to reach out to me on his own terms, even if it means not seeing him at all for the 2 weeks I'm in the same city as him?

"Are my feelings valid if I don't cut, or harm myself?","I feel like this is a hard topic for me to approach, but I would like to express some things I've been feeling. Before we start, I would like you to know this is going to be very long, and explaining things that happened in my life, and what I am feeling at this moment. Thank you, all. 

 Truly, I'm not sure if I am depressed, but at this moment I'm not willing to seek out help, outside of virtually. I hope you all understand that. But I am sad, that much for sure. I cannot express really in words what I feel, other than the fact than waking up is seeming to be a struggle at this point, always feeling overcome with such a  gloomy feeling, where if anyone pushed me I'd be constantly on the brink of tears. The entirety of being constantly upset, trying to cry, trying to find a way to let out the emotions which you didn't even know you were feeling, but being so empty, you can't even muster tears. 

I believe I started feeling these feelings around a year ago, after getting out of an abusive relationship. I became so dependent on one person, that I thought I couldn't cope without them. I made excuses for everything they did in my head, and always ran back to them. When they blamed me for their suicide attempts, because I didn't show them 'enough affection' whilst they were hospitalised, though I do not know if she was truly hospitalised, or if it was another facade, I broke. I sent over 100 messages a day, as I knew this would happen if I would not, but she didn't want me to feel happy, despite anything. Not even in the simplest of things to brighten my spirits per say. Anyhow, I had to discard my friends, she had complete control over whom I talked to, and whom I wanted to be friends with. And she forced me to choose between her and them once again. I picked her. It may be irrational to some people why I would do it, but when someone starts convincing you how much you need and rely on them, with all the things you'd planned together, with what you said, the words they, and you, said. It's so hard to turn away. I know now, it was a very, very abusive situation, which I kept putting myself into it. It wrecked my self esteem, and self worth. Through constant break-ups, and fights which I could never win, and eventually relenting to, it puts you on tip-toes, around anything you do or say.

Anyhow, after the sadness, came nothing. There wasn't happiness nor love, just nothing. I still cared for people, and loved them, but I discarded all emotions I felt for them when speaking, or trying to talk to someone. It's almost like an off-switch was flipped, I began seeing things from a perspective which wasn't how I was. It wasn't exactly pessimistic per say, just more observant. Being able to read situations not with sympathy, or empathy, more with observation.

Now, I guess, I struggle to understand how I feel myself. And this is where the issue comes in. I have known many people to cut and harm themselves. And every time I look at my situation, I cannot help but feel selfish? 

I'm in a comfortable, content position in my life. I don't feel the need to kill, or harm myself. And I feel pitying myself is so self-absorbed. I believe, if I were to tell anyone how I felt, it wouldn't be valid, it'd be brushed off as sadness as I do not have the desire to harm myself. It's hard to truly explain what I mean, and I feel I have made this post much more differentiated from the point I was trying to make. But I truly, believe my feelings are selfish.

How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist?," Tl;dr at bottom

Hey guys. So, for context: I am a 14 y/o dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. We haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, here's what's I need help with:

About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube (As it had ""rotten my brain""). He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades (Like, above 95%) but since I haven't gotten good grades (I have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. I couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I don't know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and it's all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)

After like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I don't know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:

I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh (It's a big city) and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like ""Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me"" but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since I'm a minor I can't be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?

(PS: He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say I'm wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him.)

TL;DR: I am a 14 y/o Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so.

Why does my dad react like this,"I am a very emotional boy

Sometimes my dad says things that make me sad and upset. he will be really judgemental towards me and that makes me angry alot. he tries to talk down to me like im a lesser person than him

When i cry, he asks me what's wrong. but it's not in the comforting and safe way you think. He says it really judgementally and unsafe way, and he's usually shouting when he does it. it takes him a while before he starts shouting though.

He doesnt even attempt to console me when i am crying. he scolds and shouts at me when im in public, like there's something wrong with me, when he's the one who made me up set

Afterwards he will make fun of me for being a baby and crying over everything, and i shouldn't be acting ""like a 2 year old"" anymore","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t think it’s that bad,"I don’t know if this is the best place to post this, but I do need help. I’m sorry that it’s so long. I’m also sorry for the bad English, it isn’t my native language.

Some background info:
I don’t think I’m super depressed, but my friends are convinced that I am. I made a plan to kill myself, but haven’t followed through yet.

I have previously promised to tell my friends if I made new plans to kill myself, which I did.
Now, they want me to get hospitalised so that I can “get help,” but the psych ward hasn’t helped me before.


The stuff I need help with:
I promised to “get help” yesterday, but I no longer believe I need much help. They won’t let me rescind my promise, and I desperately don’t want to break it.

I am fairly certain I’m not depressed. Even though I’ve attempted suicide a couple of times, I have ended the attempts on my own before getting hurt.


My question is: should I listen to them and go to the psych ward, or am I justified in believing I can manage on my own?

16 year old struggling with depression and drugs,"Hey guys,

I'm 16 years old and I have had alcohol a few times, and it used to be somewhat of a problem for me. When I was 15, I only had alcohol about once a month, but I always fantasized about it, and when I had it, I tried to have a lot. I was really really depressed back then, and I have tons of self-harm scars and a few suicide attempts. And now, I've gotten extremely depressed again. My ex-best friend really victimized herself and said terrible things to me, stuff like that our whole friendship was based on lies and that I've hurt her in ways that she couldn't imagine. This is due to lies that her abusive boyfriend had been feeding her, and he is a really bad person and talks trash about her so much and spills her secrets and doesn't have morals. I snapped when she was saying some really hurtful stuff to me and I told her everything her boyfriend did, which I think led to her saying those even more mean things to me. She ended up basically blocking me on everything. I went to a party yesterday and she was there and I felt so disconnected and lonely, and I vaped for the first time in a while, and there was a box cutter and I went to the bathroom to cut myself and I just felt so much better. I've also been fantasizing about alcohol so that I could stop feeling. i have tons of goals for college and life, and I don't want to sound stuck up but I have pretty good chances at a top 10 college if I keep what I have going. But this has really clouded me, that someone who knew so much about me just rejected me like that and treated me like that and I just want to stop feeling. Does anybody have any advice?

P.S.: I promise that I won't be pming anyone to stop me from harming myself or anything like that. I would really appreciate real, actionable steps that can help me just forget about this situation and go back to working hard. For example, I've heard that meditation could be really beneficial, and has anyone here tried it?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
Desperately need support,"I've been struggling with mood and motivation problems for a long time but now this has been flowing over in back and joint problems, fatigue and some small signs of inflammation.

My heads talking, dreaming and analyzing all the time, my memory and focus are down and just don't know what to do anymore. Some days all I can do is lay in bed and be anxious, other days I'm full of energy and (over) enthusiasm with bad some nights rest as a result.

I've took my walks in nature, tried meditation for a long time, went to the spa and went to the gym. The gym helped me getting motivated, but later on gave me sleep, focus and fatigue problems.
My heads full of memory's, hints and it's all just like one big spiderweb. Meditation helped me with the sleep and focus problems, but I couldn't get to the core and discover what I really want. I'm an epileptic and have PTSD and already have memory issues due to the epilepsy, so when I'm at the psych I forget a lot of stuff and/or forget to react to what the psych just said so I can complete the story.

I think I need help.(Long)(references self harm),"I’m not one to usually ask for help, im a high schooler now and for most of my life I’ve been a ‘suffer in silence’ person. However, a couple years ago, towards the end of 7th grade, I sort of began to withdraw myself from friends and family, and I basically started writing a journal in which I very heavily contemplated self harm/suicide. My parents found this and set me up with a counselor, who thinks I have major/clinical depression. She recommended I go to the doctor for very mild antidepressants, because she thought those could help. My doctor, though, didn’t prescribe them. It feels like no one takes it seriously when I do talk about this? I did begin smoking weed in about 8th grade to help cope, but have began smoking a lot less once I did meet counseling.

 I should note that it did feel better over the summer between 7th and 8th grade, but hit full swing in 8th. I’m in 9th now (still feelin it), but my friends just sort of brush it off when I mention the possibility of self harm/sadness. 
I’m not really sure what to do with myself to be honest because no one seems to care, school counselors just told me to join clubs and no one really tries to help.

Scared of starting antidepressants,"I'm a 22 year old guy

Currently in college studying economics, in my 5th year. I struggle with depression, GAD and minor OCD. 

I have major issues with motivation. Most of the time, especially when I'm stressed out the most, I lack any motivation whatsoever. There are a couple fields that interest me, but the college experience has been very stressful for me altogether.

However, I'm not motivated to do anything. Starting a new degree doesn't motivate me because I'm not passionate about anything in particular, except for statistics, and my degree is the best to undertake a specialization in that which I want to do.

Very often, if not almost everyday, it's hard to get up from bed. It's hard to eat. It's hard not to cry. I have the full support from my parents, I have friends, I don't struggle financially yet I'm profoundly unhappy. I hate myself as well. I have suicidal ideation very often.

I'm scripted benzos but I want to drop them for antidepressants. Benzos make my anxiety better and make me motivated and cheerful; but they're not something designed for long term use.

So I want to ask my doctor for an antidepressant script, since he is a very kind and understanding guy and I'm sure he'd script me what he thinks is best; however I'm profoundly scared of side effects.

I don't wanna feel like this anymore and I'm too broke to be depressed.,"This is my first time telling anyone about this so excuse me as I'm rambling. And please don't say anything like ""Thank you for saying this and taking a big step."" That really makes me feel worse about myself. 

Honestly I'm getting really sick of feeling sad and angry all the time and when I'm sad I couldn't stop crying and I couldnt control my tears which is pretty bad in Singapore (where I'm living) where general people will isolate you when you show any signs of mental health issues. And I couldn't make any friends here because of my nationality and all the prejudice I get just by being myself has been repeating itself in my mind every day. Not only that but also workplace bullying has led me to be even closed off and led me to not be able to leave the house because I felt as soon as I step out of house people will judge and isolate me which make me feels like there is no point of going out anymore. 

I know ""iTzzZ NooO BiGG DeALzzZ, all the teenage girls hv this once in their lives."" (From the two psychiatrists I've visited and I'm 26F) but I really wish I could move pass all these experiences and how it makes me feel all the time but I couldn't manage to find a therapist who I can trust and is empathetic. And I couldn't afford it regularly since I'm couldnt force myself to work for the past 8 months. I hv tried getting help from public services here but the experiences was truly horrible and it has made my condition even worse.

I've been reading books hoping I could find an answer but that doesn't really work and it couldn't calm me down.

Cheated on my girlfriend by dating a girl I met online playing games,"This all happened while I was still dating my girlfriend while she was away for an internship.

So I met a nice girl online playing a game almost like 2 months ago and the vibes between us are good. 
I confessed to her and wr started dating online. The only problem is that she seems to suffer from depression and im trying to help her, sometimes staying really late or not sleeping just to keep her company, playing games with her, shes really beautiful. She's from another country not far from here, and I want to meet her. 

My girlfriend came back recently  and found out about that I was texting and dating another girl. I dumped my girlfriend inmediately after this. I feel really sorry for her. From time to time I still miss her, last week I had been trying to contact her to make it up but she ghosted me. I miss the intimacy with her. I tried with another number but she's not picking up my calls nor answering.

"I really want to die, but feel like I can't say it.","So I've been suicidal for 7-8 years, have a plan, have access to the plans mean of suicide but every-time I mention it the cops/ambulance are called. I take 30mg Diazepam +180mg pregabalin +12mg buprenorphrine / day. Only the buprenorphine is on a script, the others were prescribed but cut-off about 4 years ago, since then I've been using the darknet for the diazepam and pregabalin. It is proper medication sourced from spain, with leaflets everything (I even sent some samples to Energy Control and they came back fine, 100% what it says on the box).

Right now, my GP, my drug-worker, my psych are all aware of this (me buying illegally from the darknet and giving zero shits) but I mentioned I'm feeling suicidal to my drug-worker (pretty much as always), and a CRISIS team was told about it. They called and setup an appointment that I went to today.

My worries are that in the past, ambulance/police teams have turned up to my house and take all my illegal diaz/pregabs (I have no ill-will towards the cops, they have to). But it forces me through a 72+hour withdrawal until I can place another order and see the psych team who just ask;

Depression and Anxiety firing up and causing me to feel like I might have a panic attack.,"So this may just be the anxiety firing up and causing me to stress and panic.  I've had trouble in the past with lonliness, both my parents have kicked me out (Because of me wanting a better job), and I've had friends in the past all of a sudden drop me or stop talking to me frequently, this left me feeling alone quite alot of the time and causing me to worry about upsetting any friends I do make. I managed to make about 3 friends that I talked to regularly, one of those friends started being really horrible, majority of the time to me and I started to get fed up of it. I called him out on it and this has resulted in me and that guy (Call him Ed) not being friends, however we'd end up in the same rooms chatting on discord because of me being friends with the two other friends, A and B, and Ed joining occasionally.   
Well recently Ed and B have started chatting more and more often and A and me talking more, however in recent rooms, me and Ed have started arguing because of the way he still tries to treat me, B has recently started acting slightly more like Ed as well, which is causing me concern and ended up with me and B having a small argument earlier today. My anxiety is spiking however because, B is talking less and less to me, and now A has started to disappear a bit more, I worry that I will end up lonely again, without anyone to talk to, as it took me over a year to make these friends after the last group of friends I had all left in one big hit.  


I bring all this up because the last time I ended up feeling like this and lost everyone I considered a friend, I nearly hurt myself quite badly...

Loneliness is taking over me,"I never realized how much I rely on having human contact and connection. I recently went through my first heartbreak and I lost a best friend and I’m losing my other friend. I feel like neither of them cared about me as much as I cared about them. 

I feel like everybody has somebody that loves them back and for some reason that makes me feel worse. I feel like I give my heart entirely to people and it hurts so badly when it’s not reciprocated in the end. I know that’s selfish of me but I wish I knew what I was doing wrong. 

I feel so alone and all I wish I could have was a genuine human connection. It doesn’t have to be romantic. Just to have someone be there and not leave me. 

My depression is coming back and the negative thoughts are even worse than before. For the first time I’ve really thought about giving up on life because I feel so useless and not good enough. 

I have one friend left but I’m afraid to rely on someone to make me happy. I know it isn’t fair. We talked and he made me feel better but when we don’t talk the emotions come back.

Ghosted by Son and His Mom,"I've been dealing really well with depression for awhile. Mostly just some hard spikes up in depression where it's a few hours of intense depression and anxiety. But this has got me in the numb, why bother zone, which I feel is the most dangerous because it can last for so long.

My son (late teens) and I had a pretty good relationship as far as I could tell, and for being half a country apart. We chatted online almost every day, and sometimes game online. It's his preferred way of communicating. We had a great time together this summer.

He stopped responding about 3 weeks ago. I texted him and he politely said the equivalent of, ""I need some space for about a week, just working something out."" I respect that and I let him know that.

I asked his mom if it was something I should worry about or if there's anything I can do to help. She responded that it's teenager stuff and he's not in danger. (Son lives with depression and anxiety too.)

So I give space.

2 weeks go by. I message him just to check in and let him know I love him. Nothing. Then a message about his upcoming psychologist appointment. I say that it's scary to me that he needs to see a psychologist, but I don't know anything about what's going on. No response.

I e-mail his mom, we mostly talk Christmas gifts but no answers about how our son is doing.

It's been over 3 weeks now. I e-mailed his mom again a couple days ago. No response. I'm worried for him. She has left me uninformed about very important things about our son before.

This is extremely unusual for him, especially for this time of year. We're usually chatting about Christmas stuff. I feel like throwing up. I'm very worried for him.

Maybe he is ok. Maybe this is just what happens. I understood the day could come when he goes off on his own and I'm an occasional thought and memory. That's what I could get for living so far away since he was a toddler.   
(Whole other story why that happened that I'm not going to get into.)

I'm not ready for it to be today. Especially knowing that something was wrong enough for him to go see a psychologist.

I don't know what to do or think about this. Any advice?

I hate winter,"My therapist and I even had a 15 minute discussion about how winter is just awful. 

Now I don't mind looking at snow. The visual aesthetics are absolutely appealing. A white Christmas is great. I like chucking a snowball at my boyfriend. And hot chocolate is my favorite. 

However, why is it so fucking dark? Sunset at 5? Are you kidding me? I'm exhausted, time confused, miss the sun, and I swear to God if it rains again at 40 degrees, I'm hibernating for the rest of the year. I hate driving in the dark. I have to go outside to get to the basement to do my laundry, which thanks to last night's snow, means going through an inch and half of snow, on top of cold mud, into a rocky cold basement at the bottom of some rickety ice covered steps, just to put something in the washing machine. We have multiple cats, so I have to dump cat boxes daily, which makes a daily run to the trashcan, now in the dark. Driving in the dark. I hate how dark it is. I hate that it looks like midnight at 6 pm. It's just absurd. 

How do you all survive winter without living in a cocoon of blankets on the bed? 

Side note, yes I am aware of S.A.D.S, but I have no medically confirmed diagnosis of it currently, though it's possible. Confirmed major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. 

TLDR: HOW DO I KEEP SANE IN WINTER??","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"27, F, single, scared","Hi all, I'm a single 27 year old who is terrified about being single forever. I find it hard to connect with people or to find people to be attracted to.

I've only ever had feelings for 3 people since I was 17, I've only ever had one relationship which lasted 6 months a few years ago. 

I have severe depression and other mental health issues, so my feelings are quite bleh in general and I'm basically asexual/have no libido for the last 6 years over something that happened that's too complicated to explain here. 

I feel weirdly repulsed when a guy is into me because I'm never into them. I'm not trying to be shallow, I just dont find them attractive usually, which brings me guilt and self loathing. I'm told a lot that I'm beautiful (I dont see it) but I just cant seem to reciprocate those feelings. I do get a lot of male attention but I never seem to run into people that I want to be with. 

Am I destined to be alone? On top of this, I'm a newly Christian woman who can only date fellow Christians now and I live in a small city with limited options. I feel awful every day as I worry that God's will for me i to be alone. I have so many things going against me. On top of this, my depression sucked out any trace of maternal instinct I had and I dont even want babies anymore, which was a dream of mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have nothing and I'm worried that I always will have nothing. Is there any positive stories out there that are like mine? I feel so alone","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills,"My parents make going out and having fun really difficult especially my step dad who constantly tracks my phone location and my bank information. He makes sure to mention every time I withdraw my own hard earned money from my account making me subconsciously feel wrong just for using my own money. Same thing with going out with my friends, he makes me feel wrong for wanting to have fun, instead he just cares about me working my youth away as a slave for someone else just for this fucking money that I hate so dearly. 

It's been like this for me basically forever, I've constantly had elders over me telling me what I should do, what I shouldn't do, things I must seek out, thinks I can't touch with a 10 foot pole etc. and I'm sick and fucking tired of it. At no point in my short life have I personally be able to make my own choices or decisions and now that that's been my life when it actually comes to me personally making decisions for myself I don't know how to. It feels like I need someone with me at all times to help me make decisions because I've never had the opportunity for myself to make decisions, someone else always was ""more obligated"" to make decisions for me instead of myself and now I'm a complete wreck in life because of it. I think this method of raising me plus child abuse is why I just feel so isolated in this reality now. 

But now I think all this loneliness in my life is finally starting to add up and take its toll on me. In school from elementary until I hit puberty at around 7th-8th grade I was a goofy class clown fun person who had no problem making people laugh and brighten up the whole room. But when my hair started thinning around 9th grade I started to get significantly more and more shy and more depressed and withdrawn from other people out  of fear of being judged for being ""weird"" or ""awkward"" eventually this fear caught up with me my junior and senior years of high school where every single person I'd have ever interacted with would judge my appearance or my hair because of how poorly it looked. I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead.

Now that I've been shy and lonely for so long when I actually try to talk to people I have a hard time forming the appropriate sentence to match what the person had said to me. Or I might form the sentence awkwardly making my point much harder to come across to them. I feel like I have to stop and really put together a sentence in my head before I can say it or else it'll just not make any sense when the person I'm talking to finally hears my response. Or I'll hesitate while talking and then it'll mess up the flow of what I was talking about and I can't piece back together the sentence I was trying to say. I've slowly became more and more self aware at how many times I've had to just completely scrape a sentence midway through because of this hesitation while trying to speak, people probably think I'm crazy by now.

I have nothing interesting to tell people either so when I'm at work and the person who's talking to me shares a story about them that happened recently I feel like I'm not given back to the conversation because I have no story at all other than depressing stories to share in the conversation, so 9/10 times I'm simply forced to only comment about their story instead of sharing my own stories. Otherwise I don't talk at all, not unless someone else starts up a conversation with me. I kinda don't even like talking to people anymore because it just feels like it's getting really difficult to make a conversion work when I'm a part of it. Only being able to reply to their experiences instead of giving them insight on my own personal experiences. I also have a extremely difficult time looking people in their eyes for more than a second, maintaining eye contact just feels really uncomfortable.

I feel so much pressure from other people too, like if I drop something I instantly feel like everyone is watching me as I pick it back up. Or when I was in school literally just standing up to turn my paper in made me feel like people would judge me for my appearance or how I walked or whatever. Being in the presence of anyone makes my life significantly more difficult, like I have to play a role in front of them so I can't be judged for being myself.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

"I don't have any motivation, and now I'm screwed","I have no motivation or energy

I've been increasingly losing motivation and energy to do anything over the last couple years, but it's gotten much worse over the past 6 or 7 months. It clicked about a week ago that I may have depression. I'm currently a junior in high school, and I was considered one of the smartest and hard working kids in elementary and middle school. I have big plans for the future and know exactly what I want to do and how I'm going to get there, but I have no energy to actually do anything. I've completely screwed arguably the most important year in high school. I've barely done any extra clubs or activities after school, my grades have been slipping, and now I'm stuck trying to catch up on work. But the closer I get to the end of this week trying to get everything turned in, the less motivation I have and the more stressed out I get. I'm not necessarily sad, I just have zero energy. I don't even have energy to get on my phone or play a game for more than 30 minutes at a time. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm just trying to get motivation for the rest of the week, and I'm seeing a therapist on Thursday.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I am sad, alone and scared.","I’ve never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger &amp; my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety &amp; often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. 

However recently I have been feeling really down &amp; depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often &amp; struggle to stop.

I just don’t want to let anyone down &amp; I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly I’m scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. I’ve never reached out for professional help either and don’t have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds.

I can't breath,"Since my mom died two years ago, I've felt like I'm drowning, my anxiety has been getting worse because I feel so alone, and the I go to school and feel so trapped. I feel like everyone expects me to be fine, to have moved on but I still can't breath. Some days her loss hits me so hard I feel like I'm going to die. I don't know how to function, how to live without her. My father is no help. He has a new girlfriend, he barely remembers that I exist. My friends couldn't handle my depression and abandoned me.

Post-divorce depression,"Hi I’m 38 and male.  I had a divorce 6 months ago.  The divorce was not my choice , but relatively friendly , I don’t see the point of staying with someone who doesn’t want to be with you.  But in a way that made it even worse .. because it just feels like she gave up on our relationship.

Since then I’ve gotten more and more depressed.  I’m originally from Costa Rica , but studied and worked in the US where I was very successful .  When I was 32 I decided to move back because I wanted to start a family in a place with more permanence and better work-life balance.  In order to do that I took a very big paycut and work at a job that isn’t really that challenging for me.  Everything made sense when I was getting married , but now I’m divorced, we didn’t have kids ( a big part of the break-up despite no medical reason for it , and both of us trying ) , and I feel like a professional failure when I compare myself to my friends and family who continued their career path.  I’m turning 40 in a year and a half and I just feel like I wasted all my 30s.  

I’m having a really hard time planning for the future , I just don’t have any goals anymore and feel like I can’t get excited for anything . 

If I think about things objectively I know I have options .   I can try to change jobs maybe get a second masters and get a two year work visa to the US or Europe to get back into the workforce .

But I have no energy or motivation , maybe I’m just afraid of trying and failing again.  Part of me just wants to give - up.  Don’t know what to do , I feel stuck .","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Randomly breaking down,"  I randomly break down and cry without warning. 

Previously, it didn’t happen often; and when it does, I was would be able to control it for a bit till I find myself hidden from people’s eye. I.e: toilet, server room etc

Recently, its like I control it anymore. The only thing i am able to do, is cover my face with my palms when that happens. 

I am m/27 and Im a working professional. Like I wear formal to work on a daily basis. I really dont want people to see me breaking down.

Sigh so...frustrated. and Angry since yesterday night,"Sigh so...frustrated. and Angry since yesterday night. My nutbar Aunt and her husband were in town.  She wanted to treatme to rise of skywalker. Me being me said coolness! (at first) but decided better part of something to say...except I've seen it before and it was meh. Would love to go see Jumanji (next level) which lead her \[it felt like\] to start over thinkinking.  What's that movie? Who's the Rock? Oh Him!...There's two? I thought they made only one? Something about  video game esk movies being a product for addhd melenials with apreciation for the art of a good movie. Even though she loves the original StarWars...and how about this depressing movie instead?  (no) Gosh you're such a pill!  I guess I made the mistake of comenting how I just like sometypes of movies but not others. I like uplifting ones, and also like funny ones. Just didn't want to see Knives out, or a nature documentary--which did look excelent, just not in the mood to see it. That lead to ""fun"" drama. about being picky (????) and now it's made things hard for her to treat me to movies and gosh she thought it'd be fun etc. But as a back up plan she happened to have some cardgames.

Meenwhile Oh. My. God. Both my parents and her taking turns tag teaming how really need to get off cymbalta because  it's becoming netorius for adding weight. and how my therapist is so evil, and by the way so is big pharma.  Dad being him wanted to rant (loudly) about 45, with Aunts husband. Probably because at christmas,  I had enough of him ranting about tech and ""civillians (his insult for novice users). and how 45 is so great for at least doing something.  And I had bluntly changed topics, only for him to talk even louder. His  way of being passive aggressive. Yesterday he doubled down on the aholery: playing videos about politics on a laptop loudly while mom decided she had enough and ""just happened"" to go for a walk. Aunt and I wanted to have fun with her new card game.  She does that in the hopes he'll get the hint he's being an ass. Rather than saying: we're trying to have a nice day.  She used to say something, only for dad to explode claiming he wants to talk politics and if we don't like it tough (basically). 

He finally got the notion after 3 hours of being a douchebag to talk almost anything else with aunts husband. He does this because no one else wants to talk polotics or go off the handle about pretty technical mondane (and boring) javascript issues.

Talked with mum about  getting as a gift  for  my birthday (comes up soonISH) a membership to planetfitness and hopefully either a membership to a zumba class, or a generic dance for fun and cardio class. lol I mis being around pretty  people! 

I got pissed the fuck off at [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) though. Because aint shit listed!   Now trying to crawl out of a fowl mood  to enjoy my day :( . I just  hate how my dads turning into a bitter angery shut in, that's willfully out of the loops and doesn't give a F about anything that isn't related to very specific things, or he'll just sulk in front of the TV with beers.

I also hate how useless feeling [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) has become and I have no idea what other places are in a similar spirit of groups meeting to make friends and do something fun.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Stuck in a rut,"I think I’m stuck in a depressed rut and I feel like I need to take action before I go further downhill. I really can’t be bothered to take care of myself lately, I have no social life beyond working and seeing my boyfriend 2-3 evenings a week, I’m close to my mum but that’s it. 

I find social interaction completely exhausting and overwhelming and yet crave it so much. The time off over xmas has left me realising that I just have no drive anymore. I’ve just sat and smoked weed for days in front of the tv/ computer and everytime I try and do something productive I give up because I either feel ill (I do have a cold atm) or just don’t feel like I know what I’m trying to achieve anymore (trying to clear up my house). 

I was going to the gym and eating healthily in November then I went through a stage where I wasn’t eating much at all so stopped the gym in fear of making myself faint (had a weird turn and fainted which freaked me out) I just can’t get myself back into it. 

I have all these great ideas of things to do to help myself but I have no clue how to do it. My boyfriends a total antisocial introvert so he’s not really much help, I need to do this in my own time for myself. 

I guess I’m asking how can I motivate/ drive myself to do something and not just feel hopeless all the time? I’m on antidepressants atm and have been slowly decreasing my dose for the past couple of years, this is my first winter on the lowest dose... do I up my dose again until I’m back in a better place? 

Also, how do you not feel guilty about relaxing/ doing something for yourself? I realise I always feel bad about spending time doing what I want but I don’t know why.

I think I have genuine depression.,"I was hit by a drunk driver in November. I got some bruises, shock, and my car was deemed total loss, but it still works just fine thankfully.

Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life,"Hey everybody,

My life itself has always been pretty good, but my quality of life has been awful for the last 8-ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of what's been going on:

* Age 13-14, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxiety/depression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxiety/worry/stress feeling continued.
* Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good night's sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatigue/brain fog. It is 24/7. Not even a second of feeling better.
* Age 17-present: Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressants/anxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tired/foggy. I’ve tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didn’t help my mind, or didn’t do anything. Caffeine in any form doesn’t help either. I’ve seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. 

I feel this intense dissociation feeling 24/7 that has gradually emerged/worsened over the past couple of years. Like I'm so tired, I don't even feel like I'm in real life ever anymore. I feel drunk/drugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.). My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. It's almost impossible to startle me. It's like my body doesn't even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia). Vision has declined (eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity). Eyes are dry/watery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but can’t feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled (Hearing, taste, smell, touch) all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually non-existent. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling really drunk. I’m slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as I’ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every cold/flu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day and/or when I’m more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to “recover”, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when I’m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.

Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeine’s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It’s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, the last kind of test I can do at this point is a sleep study, which is in a few weeks. In a way, sadly, I hope they find something.

Life advice help?,"So New Years just passed and I just went on a former close friend on mine’s instagram page and I was just on social media in general (and before I even finish this, please don’t give me, “everyday goes through life at a different pace”) I noticed that her and other people seem to have actual lives. She performs songs plays, etc , has a relationship etc. and me? No guy had ever looked my way, my life is literally wake up , school, come home, homework, rinse and repeat. I also have social anxiety so it’s hard for me to go out and even then still, I think I’m grossly unattractive. Have never ever taken a good picture, last picture I took was for the school yearbook months ago. I simply just don’t take pictures. I feel behind everyone and everything. I realize how at my age this decade is literally the decade on change for my generation, but I haven’t don’t anything. Never been kissed, held hands, complimented, looked at. And it doesn’t help that I’m a dark skin girl and nowadays boys and men seem to go out of their way especially black men, to point out how they believe dark skin girls are unattractive in all ways. I just feel behind. I mean the girl I was talking about was the girl I did everything with in elementary and middle school till we moved for high school and she had the most basic things that I can’t even get.

I have friends but I know I’m not their first choice, I feel like the leftover friend. I feel like if life is literally not happening for me, I shouldn’t even be alive, what’s the point. And I release that yes I need to go out there, but how do I do that when my head is constantly telling me all my flaws, from the shape of my nose to the darkness of my skin, to my introverted personality.

I am so confused,"I'll be straight forward, I'm not diagnosed yet. I haven't really been checked so I may still very well suffer from the condition, but I apologize if I don't qualify to post here. So my problem begins maybe three years back. Out of nowhere I'm randomly sad about myself for no reason in particular. I brushed it off as regular old sadness and have no other thought. Then a couple months later I notice it's happening more and more frequently. I thought it could genuinely have been depression, but I was convinced into brushing it off as teen angst. 

Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. 

Fast forward to now and I've started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said that's it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often they've stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just can't get what I want out of life and I don't want to live a long unfulfilled life. Don't get me wrong, I'd much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. I'm not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression?

Is being home triggering my depression?,"Hi. I'm not too familiar with this subreddit but honestly I really need someone to talk to right now.

I've been diagnosed with medical depression/ anxiety for a couple years now, taking medication and am now generally doing pretty well. I started college in the fall and the semester was amazing. However, since winter break started I've been having awful feelings about just living. 

I wouldn't say I have major suicidal tendencies but heck I've thought about it. I want to pain to go away so badly. Its gotten to the point where I feel physically sick. I can't stop crying. I feel awful.

I'm lonely here and things aren't the way they used to be. That automatically fills me with anxiety. I haven't felt this way in so long and I thought I never would again. 

I don't know what I need but maybe someone here could help. I'm scared to fall asleep because of the nightmares I've been having. Maybe someone could talk.

"Any time i speak, my mom has to point out the negative mindset/thought processing of my head, whether the negativity is fact or opinion. Makes me feel like a loser who can only see the negative in today’s world.. &amp; i’m tired of beating myself up for it","I’m 22 &amp; have had depression &amp; anxiety for over a decade- so this negative mindset that shows itself at times has always been present
Anytime i talk about something, see something awful on my parents favorite channel-the news-, or hear a conversation with points that i disagree with (lot of morals), i get told by my mom:
 “why are you looking at this so negatively?”
“why are you letting yourself get so worked up about this?”
“it’s not even affecting you directly, so why do you have such a strong opinion on this?”
“don’t get so worked up about this, just let it go”
“you only point out the negative things so i’m trying to show you the opposing view”

I understand that it is a good thing to show the opposing viewpoint so you can fully make your own opinion, but i have always been one to contemplate &amp; think of all point of views-i’m pretty open minded in that sense- but me being a sensitive person (well an HSP), i seem to first always lean towards the emotional reasoning &amp; the rational part after, or secondary, of lesser importance. Probably because i know what it’s like to feel emotionally invalid/not cared about/misunderstood, so the sympathy for others is very present. but that also makes me question why I DO get so easily affected by being told basically (well i feel it at least) that i’m wrong or my thinking is wrong. I feel no one in my family really understands either where i’m coming from or how my mind works- not that i expect them too, but i do expect a little acceptance so i don’t continue to spiral down , continuously doubting myself &amp; beliefs because i’ve been told it’s wrong my whole life.

How can I convince my friend who is struggling with depression to seek help or let me help him?,"So basically my friend (16) who we’ll call joe has been struggling with depression for months now. He used to be very open with me about it, and would frequently vent to me about his problems. About a month back, joe was at his worst, and he cut himself. I understandably was very concerned at this and brought up the idea of seeing a professional who can help him. He wasn’t very open to the idea and I think me mentioning it made him feel I was worrying too much about him, because now it seems he’s telling me less and less every time I ask him how he is doing. The other day his mental health came into the conversation and he told me he has no idea why he feels so bad all the time. I tried to pry a little bit, but he made it clear he doesn’t want to talk to me about it because 1. He doesn’t want me to worry about him, and 2. I wouldn’t get it. Fair enough... so I told him he should see a professional who can help figure out why he feels bad all the time. He said he was too scared to see a professional, which I completely understand so I offered to help him find someone. He flat out said no and changed the subject.

I think joe is depressed and most certainly in denial about it. He’s told me he’s not depressed, just sad, but he doesn’t know why he’s sad. He obviously won’t talk to me anymore about it, and he’s scared to find someone who can help him. It would be extremely beneficial for him to talk to someone who is trained to diagnose mental illnesses, or can at least help him understand why he feels like this.

So how can I convince joe to either find someone who can professionally help him or let me help him find that person?

Advice and help please,"TLDR: I’m underage, depressed and don’t want to involve my parents in this. I don’t have any friend support right now either. Not sure what to do now and feel like just giving up. 

I’m 17 this year and went for a free mental health checkup a few days ago (parental consent and knowledge not needed) which confirmed that I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. I’ve been feeling the symptoms for a little over a year now and attempted suicide a few months ago. Now that I have confirmed that I have depression, I’m not sure what to do next. They recommended that I look into getting a psychiatrist and psychologist for medicine and counseling respectively, especially since my family has a history of depression. However, since I’m underage, I need parental consent.

I’m not close to either of my parents or any of my siblings and I have quite a lot of bad memories from my childhood as well. Additionally, my father has quite a negative perception of depression which definitely would not help. My younger brother has had suicidal ideation for the past year as well (his school found out and told my parents) so my mom in particular is very concerned about him. I don’t want to burden them further or open up to them about this at all, and since my brother is not mentally well either, I feel that my parents should focus more on him.

At the moment, none of my friends know about this diagnosis and I don’t intend to tell any of them either. I pushed away my two closest friends a few months ago and I don’t trust anyone enough to tell them either. Even if I did, I don’t think they would be able to help much (ranting does not help me much and just makes me feel like a burden). I’m pretty much completely alone now and have no clue what to do. It feels like my only option is to tell my parents even though I really don’t want to and they may react very negatively. Also, I’m very tempted to just let this get worse and worse until I eventually kill myself so that hampers any attempts to get better as well.

I really don’t know anymore how to go about this isolation from social anxiety &amp; depression- it’s one of the most debilitating things i’ve experienced.,"-i’m 22. &amp; have had anxiety &amp; depression for a decade now (since age 11/12)-&amp; yes i’ve been in therapy since then, few therapists cuz no one knows how to help me (not blaming them, blaming me for being impossible)
-dropped out of art school last november (14 months ago) because Zoloft made me suicidal &amp; school was a stressful waste of money to me. 
-i haven’t had a “real job” since May 2018 (-ive had my own reselling business online for 1.5yrs but no one counts that as accomplishment)
ever since being on Zoloft i have become even more (than i already was) of an introvert &amp; very socially anxious person.
-my best friend moved out of state mad far away. 
-my other hometown friends are in college partying having a blast with their social &amp; exciting friends.
-so in the past year i have hung out/socialized with people/friends maybe like 5 times. in 365 days. i know it’s insanely disgusting that i don’t socialize. but i have no reason to. i get nothing but more stress out of it.  

what happens if i DO socialize (once in a blue moon) is:
-usually too anxious to go thru with hanging out so i “ditch” last minute, aka panic episode 
-get so nervous that i won’t be the ‘same ol me’ because my depression is so so so obvious-i mean my tone of voice is terribly boring.
-not as exciting or fun as i had hoped
-not feeling like im the same person makes it hard to be ‘myself’ (my depression-negativite thinking- used to only be visible if speaking of self, but now it’s visible 24/7) 
-when i’m hanging with someone, what’s always flooding my mind is “when do i get to leave and be alone”

BUUUT the most messed up, confusing, &amp; frustrating part is that like i’m BEGGING for socialization. like my mind NEEDS it i can like sense it. i want to have conversations with people, i want to exchange ideas &amp; thoughts, but if i go ahead and do so, it like doesn’t follow me there. in the moment i’m socializing i want to leave immediately. in moments im alone in my room, i want to be out with friends having an exciting thrilling time. but it never happens anymore. not in over 2 years. it’s like i can’t be comfortable with myself or something i really don’t know. &amp; i really don’t know what to do anymore.

-advising to take antidepressants/meds: i tried handful &amp; im not playing the guinea pig role again to then actually commit suicide this time..
-“just take a walk” : i exercise/&amp; am moving around most of the day so that’s not of help
-“just don’t put a care into anything, nothing matters in the end.” -like no shit if i could control what i care about then i would, but being highly sensitive, i can’t not care about something-everything effects deeply me whether it’s just a joke or not. and i don’t care about the end result i care about what happens now. because i feel that now. i don’t feel the future.

"I feel like garbage, and I don't know what to do.","This probably isn't that big of a problem, sorry for wasting your time if you read this.

Hi, I'm Viktor. I'm 17, I live in the US, and I just feel kinda lost.

I have a best friend that's my age. She lives overseas though. So our only method of communication is online messaging or calls. 

Recently, I've been feeling really just kinda empty and bad. I've been on break (and it's almost over) and through it all, I've struggled to feel happy. I have to fake all my smiles so that my family don't start worrying about me.

Due to this feeling of emptiness, I would talk with my friend a lot about it. But I thought that I was being annoying, so I told her I wouldn't talk with her again until I feel better. It's been about 3 days. Which is a bit because we just about talk every day.

Today I've just been crying and haven't been able to stop until a little over 30 minutes ago. It sucks, and it hurts, and I don't know what I'm doing.

Ranting,"I (15 M) am struggling in my young life. I have parents that aren't the most understanding (immigrants) and don't understand my struggle well. I'm an AP student but ever since sixtg grade, I never felt ""normal"" or ""fit in"" with others well. I stopped caring about school in sixth grade and just wanted to live my life as a care-free individual. I understand all the material at school but don't use it or my resources. I have those off days (often) and cry almost everyday at school. Some habits I have are staying in my room all day, punching myself when I am in trouble or in the wrong, and sitting on the bathroom floor for prolonged periods of time. I am harassed by a classmate (15/16 M) in AP World and stopped eating and blamed myself even though I've never talked to him before. I'm scared if I report him, his friends will come for me because they are the athletic group of kids compared to me (the only athlete in my family). I just feel that I won't make it far in life because I have less than 3.5 GPA as an AP student and can't deal with things myself. I do want to exact revenge on him with some sort of unharmful method like getting him kicked off the soccer team or expulsion (very unlikely to happen). I feel like I juat want peace with the world. My coping methods right now are crying (at least until 2 or 3), TikTok, playing games, and pulling all-nighters on school days. By the way, I'm from the US.

feeling lost but trying to keep positive. looking for some advice,"hi there.

so I've been on medication for about 5/6 months now, sometimes I think it's helping and sometimes not. I'm very new to taking antidepressants so i don't want to disregard them just yet so am trying to hopeful about them.

I had sporadically seen some therapist's over the years but not currently seeing one. my job is okay but I'm getting bored with it and I wouldn't know where to go even if I could move to a different one. 

I guess I'm just feeling very lost and down and my motivation just isn't there anymore. I have been reading lots about zen and meditation and I know exercise would help but I can't get the drive to do any of it.

I know these are fairly common symptoms for someone with depression but I don't know what to do so if there's anyone with any advice id be greatly appreciative.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please give me some advice. I really need it.,"       Hi! This is my first time talking about my problems online so I will write a lot. If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it.
       So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I don't even exist. They don't believe me even if I tell the truth and don't ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. 
      The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed.
      I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I don't seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really can't see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents.
     If anyone has come so far, thanks again, and sorry about my bad English. I really need some advice : What should i do? How can I escape this?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1

how do i ask for help,"so for a few years now i’ve considered myself depressed but i don’t know how to talk about my feelings to anyone. i tried once to tell my mom that i was “depressed”, since i’ve never actually been diagnosed, and that i’ve self harmed and had suicidal thoughts. i never actually told her that i was so close to actually doing the deed per say because how do you tell your mom that her child wants to end their life. i’ve spend days laying in my bed and not moving a muscle, not eating, not talking to anyone even my siblings, i didn’t even have the energy to get up to use the restroom. i had no energy whatsoever that i couldn’t even cry i just laid there in silence looking at my wall and hugging my dogs as they walked in and out of my room to sleep. for so long i’ve wanted to ask to go to therapy but anytime i talk about being sad and not feeling like myself my mom and sister tell my that i have no reason to be sad and that i’m just faking it. 

i think this all stems from childhood trauma but mostly from a past relationship that never should’ve been a relationship. it was so toxic and the worst first real relationship i ever had. it ruined me mentally and emotionally. the jealousy, the controlling, the emotional abuse, the pain we caused each other, just the whole relationship was horrible and i deeply regret ever getting into a relationship with her. it was always so crazy to me how everyone thought our relationship was perfect and nothing but happiness when in reality it was tearing me apart yet i couldn’t get away from it. maybe i stayed because i didn’t wanna be alone or maybe it was because i liked the attention she gave me, all i know it there was never any actual love in the relationship. it was just lust and the thought of us being together and having a future.

"27 yo Male, living with parents, having some family small businesses but personally having insignificant involvment. Dating an older women from other town. What should I do ?","Hello everyone,

I think about myself as an old child, unable to launch. Even though I started my own company, and began developing wordpress based websites, I haven't earned much my whole life. I feel like a total s\*\*t. For about a month I've met a girl in a nearby city, who is 5 years older than me. She has a stable job with a much better income than mine, but she pays for rent and says that she can't save any money. Both of us are the only children our parents have. She wants a child soon, so she is looking for commitment, but on the other way, she says that she is not willing to limit any of my freedom. I was through a couple of bad relationships and I am not into hooking up randomly and not even dating anymore.

I am very very frustrated and I don't know what should I do. Should I leave my parents, even if they need my help from time to time, take the nothing that I have and move with her? I am not confident, my schedule is a mess, I have a big problem waking up in the morning and I have no idea what to do.

I sometimes wonder if I am semi-retarded, or having some autistic spectrum disorder.

I had problems with weed and alcohol and I incline towards addiction most of the time.

I am stressed out nowadays because I have work which needs to be done, very limited time and little to no money.

"21 male, in post-relationship, feeling awful.","Hello friends, I've been thinking recently I need to talk about what's going on. I feel like my family members have heard enough of it and they don't really give me the answers or ease that I need. I loved a girl, and she loved me. She had always been dealing with mental health issues. She acted in ways she expected I'd want to facilitate the relationship. In more blunt words, she had sex with me because she knew I wanted it even though it wasn't enjoyable for her. When the issue became clear, and the distance between us bolstered, I became restless. It seemed to me she had stopped loving me. I begged her to get help for the issues, but they were so deeply connected to her life that she was hurt that I would suggest the she could overcome them. We eventually broke up. I don't think either of us stopped loving the other. She hates me now, thinks I'm some kind of asshole life-ruiner. All I ever wanted was for her to be happy. It was trauma and sadness preventing her from being happy, and no matter how hard I tried, I could not help her. That was months ago now. I started to distance myself from it all. But I still have dreams of holding her and telling her I miss her. Yesterday, it came back with a vengeance. I cried and pained, looked at her social media, seeing directed passive-aggressive posts. It was really painful. I shouldn't have done it. So I need support. Should I just be pushing through this and moving on? Some part of me wants to fix it and love her again, but I know that wouldn't be good probably. And I know that if I was back with her, I wouldn't feel the love that I am searching for. It just hurts. I dont know how to feel. I just wish I could forget. Any support and advice would be amazing. Just to know that somebody out there recognizes I'm not the bad guy, I wanted her to be happy. But my own needs became my care, and I stopped supporting a person I love because of sex. I will never not feel shitty about that. But it wasn't just sex! It was more than that; it was my physical connection to my SO which is very important to me. Anyway, I'm done.

Depression-Why is every remedy have a placebo effect on me? And why can it never stay longer then a week?,"I’m talking literally any type of treatment for my depression. Some examples:

-Tried Celexa, the following week the depression had lessened (cuz i had so much faith in this pill cuz it helped my friend) then when it was when it was supposed to start “working” (they say all antidepressants take at least a month to work) which was around the time my ‘back to normal depressed me’ depression came back. Of course they would sometimes up the dose just to see, but it never had the same impact as the first few days did.

-Tried Ashawagandha &amp; Holy basil (adaptogens) &amp; felt relief of anxiety for a few days, then back to same old GAD self (cuz i have faith in natural remedies)

-Tried yoga &amp; exercise, but hard to keep up with when i’m too depressed &amp; anxious (&amp; it’s freezing out) to leave the house . i’d workout more in my house if the ceilings weren’t so low &amp; i had more privacy (i hate being watched, yes even if someone’s in the other room doing their own thing &amp; not even looking at me) 

-Tried eating more healthy (not saying i eat unhealthy), felt good for like a meal then nothing, but i’m such a picky eater it’s hard to always eat ‘the right stuff’ 

-Tried Positive affirmations, about 1/15 times it can give a little relief, but nothing that a deep breath couldn’t do

-Tried deep breathing, helpful to slow down breathing when anxious but extremely hard to remember to do

-Tried (&amp; still trying) therapy, but i’ve had multiple therapists &amp; after a bit it just turns into a chore/exhausting to continuously bring up like “yep, today i get to bring up my depression again &amp; remind myself of all the bad stuff yet again”.

I'm nothing without my medication.,"Hey, i'm Bradley. I'm turning 16 close to the end of this year. This year's exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. It's stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Here's where the first problem comes in: when i'm not stressed, I don't worry about the exams. So in the end, there's completely no effort when the day comes.

Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, i've missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I won't elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didn't relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, i'm kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle.

Everytime there's signs (which are triggers, but i'm afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because i'm just too scared to) i'm always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these ""anger moments"". 

It's tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I can't handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better (I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?). I seem to never forget that without medication i'd be dead. I don't know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. It's masculinity, right? If we could handle this, we're stronger than others, right?

People always tell us that it'd be better if they understood what I was going through, but must I really tell _everyone_ that I have depression?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Therapy is too hard i don’t know what to try next because there is nothing out there that can help me.,"It’s way too difficult. I can’t do anything i’m supposed to be doing. I can’t take deep breathes when i’m feeling anxious because it feels like i’m suffocating myself. I can’t let something go because i don’t understand what that means with thought because reoccurring thoughts are always present. I can’t get past anything because my mind is too fucking powerful and only wants to feel terrible. I’m useless, hopeless, &amp; this is all pointless.

I am the problem,"It was always me who didn’t fit in.People don’t like me and I don’t understand why. No matter what I do, I’ll always be an outcast, I’ll be always made fun of. There’s something about me that other people hate.

I push people away.

I’m 21 years old and I never had real friends. At 13 I lost all of my friends and I haven’t made new ones.

I missed out on life. On those first experiences, parties, all of the fun that teenagers do. I don’t even feel comfortable talking to men, because I never had male friends…

I have never been invited to a party. I have never smoked or took alcohol… I never spoke with someone other than my relatives on phone or skype…

It’s hard for me to make friends now, because of lack of these experienced. Everyone has their friend group from high school, but I was bullied in middle and high school….

Recently, my 17 cousin laughed at me because I’m a virgin.

It’s true. I never had the opportunity to explore, because I had no one to explore things with…

And it hurts me, because I have no idea how to flirt with men or even keep a relationship.

Recently, I was texting this guy and he weirded out that I never had sex or kissed someone…My lack of experience pushed him away…

Without these necessary experiences it’s hard to be accepted…. 

I feel like hanging myself.

Hey 👋 Deserving Positive Treatment,"I got out of a really shitty relationship and now I’m trying to put myself back together. 

I think one of the most difficult things I face with depression is not feeling like I deserve anything. I was on the r/listenandvent chat room and I asked for hugs—virtual hugs, yes, but even the act of asking for something made it easier for me to accept any sort of affection.

Is it worth trying more anti-depressants?,"Hey everyone,

My depression has been out of control over the last year. It's always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. I've been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time I've been talked into anti-depressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. 

Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another I'm blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now I'm very apprehensive about even trying another SSRI/SNRI

As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the world's richest third world country(the U.S.), all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for.

Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRI's and I'm fucking terrified that they'll make me feel like he last one and I'll give in and do it.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I need help *TW, self harm thoughts*","Hi. I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any issues. I've never even looked at this sub, I just needed to find something because I have nobody to talk to so I used the search bar. I've never admitted any of this out loud. I've never typed them to anybody either, just in the memo section on my phone, where I keep a diary in case I end up killing myself. 

I'm not technically suicidal, I'm not trying to find ways to kill myself. I just want something to happen to me so I can just die. I'm currently on a road trip with my kids (two sons, ages 3 and 1) and my parents. We're on our way back to our home state, my husband is there. I want to get out of the car to pee or something at a rest stop and get hit and die on impact, I don't want anything to happen to my parents or my kids.

I've been having thoughts like this for a long, long time while walking or driving alone. I never have them when I'm with other people. 

I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD from childhood trauma, and have gone to a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was on an anti-depressant (Zoloft) but had to stop as it was causing me to have stroke symptoms. 

I feel like none of my friends give a shit. I'm aware this could be my mental illness telling me this, but I can't help it. Nobody ever asks me how I'm doing, and I ask them every day. I message or call them immediately after they post a concerning status on Facebook, check on them on anniversaries of loved one's deaths, etc. Nobody asks how I'm doing unless I stop replying to them for over a week (which I have done twice over the last year by muting all notifications from messaging apps when I'm particularly depressed and can't handle anything else). When I post in group chats about something I'm done or my sons have done, I feel like somebody always has something happen right then and whatever I've shared gets ignored. I've stopped telling people about my life and venting, and nobody has asked. 

Things have been stressful at home. My husband lost his job in the summer and neither one of us has been able to find a job. We were denied for government assistance, but my husband gets payment from the VA and unemployment.

Because of this stress, my husband and I fight all the time. We love each other, it's just so hard. I feel like if I told him about all this it would just add to his stress.

I've thought about putting myself on a psychiatric hold but I haven't. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have nobody to talk to. I have a suicide diary in my phone. I've attempted before (when I was 16, so almost 10 years ago). I don't want to commit suicide, I just want something bad to happen to just me and I die. I know this is wrong and not a good sign, I know I need to see a therapist and get on more medicine but we have no insurance.

I can't help but feel obnoxious, like a burden, unwanted, unloved, like I'm just being used, like I'm a terrible wife and mother. I even wrote in my suicide note that if I'm ever found dead, to cremate me and throw me in the trash. I don't want to die necessarily because of my boys and my husband, I love them more than anything. I just can't help these thoughts and I feel terrible about it. And my husband has no idea, and neither do my boys. I just want to feel like I'm enough, I guess. I don't even know if this makes sense.

Why can't depression ever be gone forever?,"Hi, sorry i still dunno how reddit work yet. I just joined and it's  my first time talking about such stuff online. I've been diagnosed  with depression and few other stuff few years ago and i had treatement and such until i felt better but whenever i got into an argument with family i could feel it crawl back in me. Up until now I've  been strong enough to overcome those small situations. And even tho i feel better most of the time i can feel it whenever i'm sort of reverting back to it. Like i start to go out less and less, i stop talking to people online and irl and answering the phone becomes a hard task.. then i start to distract myself by bingewatching shows so i don't leave space to thinking, i don't/can't sleep at night and i have a hard time remembering things i just did or dont realize I've done them. And i like  reading but it becomes hard like i can't focus and i end up skipping lines or read without remembering/understanding what i just read. The more i stay home the harder it is to get out. Anyway that's how i know shit is getting serious. Other than that i sometimes have a hard time swallowing food the doctor said it was anxiety a lack of magnesium and having supplements did help but anyway. Two days ago came back home i was in a good mood i brought sweets for everyone at home except i fould out novody was there. I have a kitten at home i brought it recently about two months ago. it's  5 months old and it still pees in the wrong spots when it's  far from its litter. The past few weeks it peed 3 times on my blanket and i had to take it get cleaned everytime. I barely got to use it so this time i had put it in a closed room so the cat cant get to it. But a cousin of mine opened the room to feed the cat there and my father had taken away the litter out of the room because that's  what he does .. whatever he likes basically. Anyway when i came back i found the door open and pee on the blanket that i had just taken out of from cleaning a night before and put aside away from the cat but there it was dirty again. I got mad. And i couldn't get angry at anyone. I felt like even when i did my best to avoid something it happened again. And i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. I mean i know it's a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldn't  stop laughing for a while. I guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldn't  stop crying. And when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasn't  feeling well but i didn't think id react that way now. I thought everything was fine. Now i just don't know if i really am. The only reason i can think of as the source is that I'll be taking classes again after almost a year now I've failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression  was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool  i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. I don't  know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging  person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. After that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. I'm  afraid that's  the cause but i don't  want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. This thing is already going on for too long. I'm  not sure what I'm  asking you here. But i guess i want an opinion or advice. I'm worried i can't tell when I'm  not ok until symptoms get physical and how am i supposed to deal with that.. what if it affects how i deal with stuff negatively  and I'll  only be aware of it when it's  too late.

I'm a 14 almost 15 year old that lack confidences and have very low self esteem. Plus hate my appearance and it ruins my life.,"I just realized people try their best just to avoid talking to me especially at school. I often get ignored and pushed aside from my classmates during anything. Even the teachers and staff won't give me the light of day, when i need it most. Also comparing myself to others to the point where it's an obsession. I can't stop! Some of my classmates &amp; friends have features that i desire: curves, pretty faces, &amp; lighter skin colors. (But sadly can never have without plastic surgery) They are highly praised and make me feel ugly.

I’m a depressed first responder and I need advice on how to get better.,"Im 26 and for the last 2 years I’ve been suffering from a persistent feeling of sadness, inadequacy and loneliness. The problem is, I shouldn’t be. I finally achieved my dream of being a police officer and I couldn’t be happier at work. But that’s where my happiness ends. When I’m not at work the feelings of sadness come back and I’m a recluse. I don’t really have any friends to speak of, I’ve gotten fat, I don’t have a girlfriend and I never leave my house. None of my past hobbies interest me anymore. 

For a long time I ignored the symptoms because it’s such a taboo in my field. But I finally realised that’s not helping. I want to get better but I want to do it on my own terms.

feeling very weak,"I'm extremely passionate and hardcore about my career, but I'm a carbon copy of my mother. Just like her, I'm starting to develop and have problems dealing with depression. The city I go to college in is ugly and amplifies my depression ten fold.

Depression hopelessness mixing with anxiety?,"A lot of days, as the day comes closer to ending (this happens much more in the winter months) I get this most uncomfortable feeling that sets in.

Depression after graduating university,"I graduated from university a few months ago and am in limbo back home with my parents. I am supposed to be applying for jobs but I feel completely paralysed with fear. I have always suffered from incredibly low self-esteem.

My parents are really critical of me so I have started avoiding seeing them and just spending my time in my room alone. Friends are all busy with work and university. 

I feel incredibly low. I have not left the house in 11 days now and can barely muster up the energy to brush my teeth and shower each day. My days have no structure and I just eat junk food as I feel too lethargic to prepare proper meals for myself. Each day I wake up late (11am-ish) and then count down the hours until 7pm when I can start getting ready for bed again. Getting into bed is perhaps the highlight of my day as it means another day of my life is over with. 

My mum just came in my room and told me I need to sort myself out. She finds it all pathetic and is angry at me. I get it. But that is not what I need. Can she not see that I am not well at the moment?

I also have been suffering with anxiety. Everyday there is something new to worry about. Yesterday I thought I had breast cancer, a couple of weeks ago it was cervical cancer, etc. Even applying body lotion to my arms I am scared I am going to see a dodgy mole.

I just feel so hopeless. But I get these brief moments of sadness when I think to what I was like this time last year. I was in university, surrounded by friends, top of my year, genuinely springing out of bed to go to university. I don't know how it went bad so quickly.

I know I can turn it around. Sunday night I prepared a simple to-do list to just look for jobs and identify three I wished to apply to. A simple task which breaks down the scary process of job hunting down to tiny steps but it is Wednesday and I still have not done that.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I really only want to have sex with someone I'm really emotionally attached too, and I also want my first time to be with someone else who hasn't done it yet. I kinda just assumed that sex would come in it's own time until I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago, where now I'm being told that I should avoid relationships for the sake of my mental health. She was also the one who demeaned me for not having had sex before and sorta the reason I need it to be someone else's first time too.

How do I tell my friends and family that I am depressed?,"I am 21 years old, I’ve been dealing with depression ever since high school but never discussed it with anyone until this year. Last semester I visited my school’s counseling center because I just felt so shitty.

I finally saw a counselor and explained everything I have been feeling and she suggested that I see a psychiatrist.

"(22F) Under the poverty line, don't know how to apply for assistance or what I would qualify for, need help navigating the system because my head keeps spinning (NOT asking for money, just need help getting some)"," 

((I'm new to reddit, and this is a throwaway account, so please forgive me if I committed any reddit faux pas))

I need help- not direct financial aid, but help navigating the system. I know I should qualify for financial help, but I have no idea how to go about it or which programs to pursue.

I'm scraping by, deep in student loan &amp; hospital debt that I can't afford to pay because I can barely make rent, trying to save up for a super-cheap, used, under $1,000 car so I can get a better job (I currently work retail part time and take painting &amp; illustration commissions part time), but I'm exhausted even working the few hours that I do (thanks, brain). I've been struggling with depression &amp; anxiety since my freshman year of college (2015), culminating in a suicide attempt &amp; an involuntary stay in a mental hospital a little over two years ago. I can't afford counseling, and I can't get medication without a car. It's been a while since I've been on meds. Not sure I would be able to afford it if I could reach it. I was raised in a cult-like Christian conservative homeschooling home, so until college I was very isolated from modern culture, ""common"" sense, and a normal view of the world. Because of this, I have no idea how social programs work. I'm still scrambling to figure out how the normal world works. I tried applying to Modest Needs, was told I made too little to qualify, started looking at government programs, and got just absolutely completely lost.

Any suggestions for ways to make/earn/get money welcome as well, just keep in mind I don't have a lot of energy at the moment...

Has anyone who's had similar struggles in the past have any advice? Any resources? A suggestion for a place to start?

...

Other possibly relevant details about me:

\-I know that my income places me solidly under the poverty line

\-I think I may have ADHD or something similar but have never been evaluated for it

\-I was \*\*\*VERY\*\*\* briefly homeless, slept in a tree at one point and in my car (had to sell) another, but there's no documentation of that (it was remarkably short, I'm very lucky)

\-I live in California &amp; I am a US citizen

\-I am cis, pansexual, female, &amp; white as a ream of printer paper

\-I was disowned &amp; cut off by my family for religious reasons

\-I have some, small documentation of my mental illnesses, but because of those same mental illnesses, I can't make it to a doctor often, so the paper trail is inconsistent, spotty at best

\-I was in college 3 years, was in my senior year (I brought in credits) when I ran out of money and had to leave, never graduated

\-I pay rent under-the-table, I don't \*legally\* reside at the place I live

\-I have terrible credit- lots of student and medical debt, I've never had a credit card but I've been wondering if getting one might help

\-I've never applied for any governmental assistance before (aside from scholarships)

I can't think of any other details that might be relevant but feel free to ask any questions, aside from this protective anonymity I'm an open book.

Where to go and how to get diagnosed.,"For years I’ve gone through what I self diagnosed as episodes of depression. They usually last about a month or two of being super down and not having any drive to do anything at all. I’m 21 now and it has been this way since 15 years old.  When I was 17 I told my mom I was depressed and I told my guidance counselor in high school. Nothing came out of that except they sent me to a doctor to get blood drawn for some reason and I was sent on my way because the counselor said maybe I have a thyroid issue. Terrible counselor and terrible doctor. Never went back. Not blaming my mom either I just think she doesn’t really understand what I’m saying I feel. I’ve talked to her about it a lot and she usually just tries to support me and tell me things will get better or “you’re just in a rut right now”. Which can sometimes piss me off. But she is in no way doubting me or anything like that. She even told me to go see a therapist or doctor. But I don’t know where to go or even how. Who do I go see to get a diagnosis? I don’t want to be brushed off again.  Instead of trying to self analyze my problems and try to treat them my own ways I’d like to finally get closure and see if I really am depressed, or something else, or just dramatic.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

How do I become a person?,"Ok That might be a weird question but I needed to ask. 

I’ve had depression all my life. During early childhood, teenage years, and now as an adult. 

Happiness is exhausting. Nothing is relaxing. Everything is just boring. I’m either angry or I’m numb. I don’t even take showers to feel clean anymore. I just take them so I can waste time and feel like I can go to bed sooner.

Here’s my problem. I don’t remember if I developed a personality before my depression took over. I don’t know if I was a real person as a child, or if I was just a puppet or something. 

I feel like I’m floating in life and I don’t know how to develop a personality. Does anyone have any ideas at all where I can start? Things that used to calm me down just make me angry and frustrated.

How can I support the man I'm dating who is depressed?,"The guy I'm dating has been having a tough week due to two things happening and I think it has triggered his depression (he's told me about his mental illnesses before). Our relationship has been amazing so far but this week he has been really quiet with me and doesn't want to talk, and now it has come to leaving my messages on read. I'm really concerned about him because I don't want him to feel he has to suffer alone, but I also understand that everyone copes with things differently, and perhaps he just needs to get his thoughts in order before talking to me again. 

I've sent messages telling him I'll always be there for him and nothing will push me away, and I know how rough it can be because some of my family members also suffer from depression. I've also told him I will give him space to think and get his mind in order and that he can message me anytime he feels like talking, but I do want to keep checking in on him over the next few days to show I'm there for him.

If anyone else has any advice on how I can support him, then it would be greatly appreciated, thank you.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
My boyfriend cheated on me multiple times,My boyfriend of 8 years cheated on me multiple times each time I found out and confronted him each time he had been apologetic and he told me he doesn't know why through tears. Each time I've forgiven him and moved on. But this time was different before it was mostly through texts and occasionally kissing. This time I found out he actually had sex with the girl and lied to me until there was no way he could. He promised that it would never happen again and that he never wants to hurt me this way again but even though I want to forgive him and move on I have been having a lot of uncomfortable thoughts and I have been picturing things and although I am still very attracted to him intimately it has been hard not to let it get to me during it.

My girlfriend (22f) no longer can find enjoyment in things that we always loved doing,"Me and my girlfriend are huge music fans and a big part of our relationship is going to gigs. We used to go to a gig almost every week and it was always really good bonding time. She has depression / anxiety but she was pretty comfortable in gig enviroments as long as she has some personal space.

For a couple of months she has seemed more awkward less excited when going to gigs. We went to a show last night of a band she really loves, and she seemed uninterested / unhappy throughout the show. On the way home she admitted to me she doesn't feel any excitement for going to any shows at the moment she doesn't know why and is sad / frustrated as it was one of her favourite things. She says she feels panicky and stressed to just be there.

It's hard to understand what could've triggered this big change and i don't know what i can do to help her. It's hard to know how to make her happy if she doesn't seem to get enjoyment out of anything. She says i'm the only thing keeping her going which is really hard to hear and feels like a lot of responsibility.

If anyone can share any ideas or advice or similar experiences i would greatly appreciate it.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I just realized I'm very depressed but I don't know why.,"Before today, I didn't even know or even seriously consider that I may be depressed. To me it just seemed normal, and probably due to the gradual increase of the severity I simply didn't connect the dots.

From what I can recall it's been going on since I was around 12, back in 2014. First I remember becoming quite lazy and finding getting anything done an incredibly hard challenge. I thought it was just because I was a teenager, and lazyness is a normal teenager status. Then I started having a lot of anger issues, I'd get pissed off for the most minute things, I had an incredibly short fuse but I just thought it was also normal teenager behavior. Eventually I managed to suppress those explosions so they'd go off in my head but no one would notice. I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy a lot, like math, and went from reading 30 books a year to reading 0 last year.

I think I was around 15 when the first suicidal thought occurred. Every time I'd fuck up and get grounded or yelled at, or faced consequences for my actions I'd just think over and over again that I wasn't worth anything. Those thoughts disappeared for some time, but arose back last year. I, again, thought it was normal. I think the reason they stopped is because I was at a relative high in my life, I had entered college at 16 years of age and everyone I knew was proud of me, and I felt good about myself. Or so I think I thought.

I feel like I can speak for any teenager out there that mastubating is normal. Yet I'm not sure when, it became a daily thing, and then 2 or 3 times per day. Also I stopped showering, I don't even know why. I just didn't. I'd go into the bathroom, turn on the water and just sit on the toilet looking at it or my phone. I stopped cleaning my room and then stopped washing my clothes. I'd wait till the last pair of underwear, maybe reuse it a few times and then wash enough clothes for a week, while months of clothes were piled up. My dandruff got much worse, and the suicidal thoughts came back every once in a while. Not sure if it's got anything to do with this but I started driving really aggressively, well past the speed limit even after a ticket, something I didn't do when I got my license. Lastly, I've always been very thin, as a male I still weighed around 120lbs ish. Now I'm around 130, which I know is still nothing, and I don't think I'm fat or anything like that, but I'd never in my life gained weight, and suddenly I was 10 lbs heavier in a matter of a few months. All of this paragraph started around the same time.

Today I was talking to a friend of mine over the phone and for some reason he just asked me: ""are you depressed?"" Which left me thinking, yet my college classes distracted me for enough time. Today at dinner my mom finally lashed out over my lack of hygiene, it's then that I realized I haven't showered in months, nearly a year of sometimes washing my hair or just standing under the water every once in a while.

I showered and it dawned on me that I, probably have depression. The mere realization made me cry more than I've cried in years. I read all about ""seek help"" and ""tell your parents about it"" but I'm kind of ashamed to admit it. They've given everything to provide for me and my sister, and I've got all the ingredients for what I'd assume is a normal and functioning life. It feels like I have no right to be feeling like this when there's people who have it much worse than me.

Im posting it here because I need anonymous support. I'm not yet ready to admit it out loud,but I think I'm depressed.

"Felt like I just should die, even if I don't want to.","Hello guys,  


It must be like three days that I'm registered on Reddit (sorry if I say something weird or wrong, english isn't my first language, you can correct me if there is a mistake and you feel like it, that's not a problem I hope) and I was trying to give an advice to ""people"" like just an advice that I believed was good to follow if a person was in a bad situation with someone with wrong intentions someday.  


My point was only to help, and I never said in the comment in question that I've got all the knowledge in the world and that my advice was an order or whatever. But yet, somebody just told me that I should not have said what I said (the advice) because in her case (which was a very bad one, like a situation I hope nobody would live, even if I know that everyday people unfortunately experience it and I had too, but I never said that in my comment or in reply to her because I didn't have to and whatever) and I felt really attacked by her. Because she made me really feel like a bad person, as if I was even coupable of what would have happen to her in the past, and she told that BECAUSE she did not do what I was giving as an advice, she lived. But if she did what I have said, she would have been dead, and she made me feel really guilty about it.  


The point is, that I was just trying to help and she didn't have to talk to me like that. I didn't knew where to post what I am posting right now, because for the record, I've been depressed for more than ten years and I experienced like, almost one time a year (one time could be hours, days, weeks or months) of me feeling like I really should kill myself. And I'm even in one of this episode for a few weeks and everyday I try to help at least one person a day. Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help. It might not always work or be the better thing to do in some situations or for some people but I cannot know everybody's lives and everyone's situation and as a highly sensitive person too, I am ALWAYS trying to write/speak in the way of not trying to hurt anyone, to be as kind as possible (I am a kind person actually, so I try to be it even if I feel like I just want to die) and so on.  


I was feeling like a total mess last night because of the comments of this girl, because she was really telling me that I was like kind of guilty of giving not any advice but like, I was helping people to get killed in some way. She did not actually say that but I really take it badly and I still feel like, because of what she told me (a total stranger, yes) I treated myself like I was right to believe that I should kill myself because I was just a piece of shit to the world and because I was angry too and really bad, at a moment, by brother tried to told me a joke that wasn't funny and I just talked to him really really badly so he got the impression that I didn't even deserved to be talked to and left. To some point, I've been crying for hours, feeling suicidal, and even went to my mom who just told me to stay away from internet (yes at that point, but it was just some girl on reddit but, still) and I felt terrible because I don't have any real good support anywhere in real life.  


I don't even know why I am posting that, I guess I need it out of my chest, and was in research of kind words, and good people. I don't know if anyone would even comment or saw my post, but well. Even if I don't have a plan to kill myself and don't want any of course, I feel like I should die and I am so tired of feeling this way. I know I don't deserve that because I am a kind person and a loving person who cares a lot. I tried to post this on another sub but while I was writing, I guess I just should post it here. I don't know if I have done the best thing, but I have to go, so I guess I will see in the day if anyone would have answer me.  


Hope you guys have a good day, evening or night. Take care.

"I want to learn to appreciate the positive gay inclusion and acceptance, and stop letting homophobia and gay exclusion and alienation burden me","I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, and/or people against men being allowed to be feminine.

&amp;#x200B;

And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feel-good escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I can't even use that, since the type of movies and shows I'm interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they don't, the representation is poorly handled.

&amp;#x200B;

I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character I've seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtube-exclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesn't exist within these genres.

&amp;#x200B;

But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers: Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

And furthermore, people ARE getting more gay-supportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better. But I keep feeling so sad and depressed and tired of life, feeling like there is no escapism properly working for me whenever I feel down. And I just don't know how to deal with it.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
I have something that I don't know the name of,"Hi, fellas. I will tell my history. I'm writing this at 4:46 AM on January 24, 2020. Well, I think all of this has began at early 2019. Before It all. I has to introduce myself right? My name...Well, I won't tell it. You can call me as you wish. Born early 2000s. I live in Brazil. Let's go. Like I said before, everything has start at all early 2019 (I guess). I start to imaginating me fucking with some people especially my nieces one is a kid and another a baby and I cumming on it. This impacted me...you now? Suicide. But this happen to another people why this impacted me? I imaginated me having a pee pee on my friend's girlfriend. Have a period of time that I imaginated people without their eyes. Actually has periods that I had fear of becoming blind. I don't if is because I have made jokes about a ""friend"" that have one eye blind. He have his moments of stupid speech but this don't justified what I have done. Have a time that I watched Gotham (2014) that Is a tv show. There is a Joker on the series, and for a period I wanted to be him, kill people you know? Why? Why? Why? Have a time in mid 2018 that I was in conflict religiously. I wanted to know that If god or satan really exist. I guess that I've prayed for my mom die? I've prayed to rain? For both? You know now I'm in conflict with the numbers 12 and 18.  My nieces have been born in years that ends there. I don't know what to do. I am racist? I can't have a relationship with women. Well, once I was masturbating and when I was going to thought the name of my niece. Once I was watching porn and remembered of the name of father of my friend. It happens with one of nieces too. I think it's because the father of my friend will become our neighbor (I guess) And I have interect with my niece then this happens. And I always hated to interect with children. And this had happens. I start to hate recently my family. Seems like that the universe want me to die. I had for a period bipolarity once I was happy then sad. I have social anxiety. My life sucks. And I'm only 17. Seems like nothing is real. Some days ago I've dreamed that I was fucking with my mother. This is because that have porn video that have this genre. I start to believe that I would live a 2nd life because I want to be happy but I can't anymore. I must believe that this is a disease/mental illness because If it won't means that... I don't know actually what that means. Help me please. I'm afraid of taking a bus to search for work and lost my self. I read something I think I'm dumb and must die. Well on 5th grade I hit my self with books then... I thought I'll kill myself with overdose. But now any way must work. And more and more world goes crazy I thought kill myself is the best. I f you could help, I'll be grateful. You know what happens with guys like me on prision i saying about what ive imaginated. If you could help, I'll be grateful. I thought if i was in prision i would kill a police guard and laugh just to the others dont hurt me. People says, ""Death shouldn't have to be an option"", read this fucking history about me. Do you think that I have a chance? The shame of having a mental illness unknown, is bigger than me. If you could help, I'll be grateful. Ps: i've written this on my smartphone on my bed. I don't know why I've said this (PS) The imaginations has happen equal to animals, dog. I don't know why but i like me doing cool things, i imaginated me likle satan, lucifer, king of hell, prince. Maybe because i watched lucifer or like devil may cry. Watched dmc5 recently. Every day i think on suicide. I don't know if this is sad. Once on tv i saw a childhood abuse case and i didn't feel empathy (I guess)&gt; Some time I feel empathy principal when i was reading comic books.

Loneliness,"It has come to the point in my life, where I just feel lonely. I know that there are people close to me, that there are people who care about me, but sometimes, I just feel lonely. I usually enjoy the feeling of being alone. I love sitting at a bench in the middle of nowhere in the darkest of night, when noone is around and nobody but the stars sees me.
But I hate this loneliness... It creeps into me like a dagger, slowly pushed into my heart, wraps my brain and emotions in a blanket of coldness, softly whispering in my ear that I'm alone...that no one really cares about me...
I can fight against it, I can entertain myself to not feel it. I can figth it by talking to people, by making silly jokes or watching YouTube or playing video games.
But sometimes, in the middle of the day, it comes creeping back to me.
It seems to be around me all the time, just waiting for the moment, I let my guard down... Just waiting to close its hands around my throat and rip my heart right out of my chest... Dragging me down into an ice cold sea of nothingness and loneliness.

I know this demon of loneliness is wrong. I know, that there are people who care for me and who like me... But still, I don't know how to win against this demon.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I hate how bad I am at art, but I don't know what to do about it.","Hi, so I'm an amateur artist (like REALLY amateur), my art skills suck and despite trying for over a decade I can't seem to improve. Art has always been a passion of mine, as well as something I genuinely enjoy doing (on the extremely rare occasion that I manage to produce a slightly-less-s\*\*\*-than-usual drawing at least) so feeling like my art is stuck at the sub-deviantart level has made me incredibly frustrated and is probably the leading contributor to my depression. It's getting to the point that I'm beginning to wonder if I should force myself to avoid art in general just to keep the self-hatred at bay.

The problem is that I don't know WTF I'm supposed to do about it. I tried to ignore it for a couple years, tried to tell myself art was just a phase and I wasn't into it anymore, but that didn't work. I've tried multiple methods of improvement; I've taken both private instruction and community college classes, but I seem to have terrible luck as they've all been pretty crap. I feel like I've exhausted all of my options. I haven't tried online classes, but judging by the reviews I've read for places like Udemy and Skillshare I doubt they'd be any better.

I've tried looking for tips online, but all I get is basically the artist equivalent of ""git gud"". It seems like the only option I have left is just practice nonstop for the 20 years and hope I magically improve Saitama-style. Unfortunately, I just don't think I can do that. I've had so many setbacks and failures in my life that I genuinely don't think I have the patience to wait until I'm in my mid-40's before I'm halfway decent at drawing. Even worse, the fact that I'm colorblind and extremely nearsighted (as well as lacking whatever Matrix-vision lets you visualize an object as brush strokes and color values) makes me wonder if practice would even do me any good at all.

Anyways, I've rambled too much. TL;DR - I suck at art, I don't know how to **not** suck at art, and this makes me really f\*\*\*ing depressed.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Alternative Treatments?,"After almost a decade of therapy and meds, I’m officially “treatment resistant.” I don’t think I can keep going with how I feel but I don’t want to give up. So I’m looking for alternative treatments to typical psych drugs. 

I (21F) have depression (dysthymia, cyclical depression), anxiety (GAD, panic), OCD (with dermatillomania), and PTSD. 

I’m currently on Pristiq and Abilify but they don’t work. 

Some things I’ve tried: 

1. Dozens of prescribed meds: Zoloft, Prozac, Xanax (got addicted), Cymbalta, Buspar, hydroxyzine, bupropion, Trintellix, Wellbutrin, etc.

2. Therapy: talk, exposure, acceptance, etc.

3. Supplements: NAC, l-theanine, caffeine, vitamin B, vitamin D

4. Illegal drugs: mescaline, LSD, LSA

5. Legal drugs: Siberian motherwort, dagga, CBD (not in a legal marijuana state), kava kava (tried today, helped but worried about liver + interactions with other meds)

I can’t afford ketamine therapy. I’d consider microdosing LSD but I don’t have access to it currently. Anyone got any other ideas?

How to talk to someone you love when they’re in a bout of depression,"Depression hurts.  I know this, took years to work mine out.  I’m mostly stable now but hubs is struggling.  Been to a couple therapists over the years but never really had any success/found one he could connect to. The few meds he tried made him worse.  He holds it together pretty well most times.  But when he drops he pushes everyone away, yells, and gets very defeatist; it hurts. I often find myself saying and doing the wrong things and making it worse.  I have the kids go to their room and be quiet. Sometimes I get mad at his behavior until it sinks in what his brain is doing. I apologize but it doesn’t take the pain away.  I don’t know how to help him.  I suggest therapy but he poo poo’s me.  He’s getting worse and I’m worried.

No energy,"Do you ever feel like everything takes a huge amount of energy? Like even making myself some food or going to my japanese or pilate class takes soo much effort. I'm always tired and feel like my batteries are empty, and when I think of all the things I have to do I just feel like going back to bed. Even the things I usually like seem so tiresome and I everytime I have to force myself so hard to do them. Reading is the only thing I still enjoy.
When friends or family come over, I afterwards need so much time to just recharge. What can I do to change that feeling? Next month a friend of my boyfriend will stay for a few days and just after that my brother in law will also stay for a few days with his wife and kid, and just to think about it makes me want to cry. I just want to stop being so powerless all the time. To top it all I sleep very badly, overthink everything. I thougt having some outside from work activities would help. I have been in therapy for depression for 15 years and the last two years went really well, so my therapist and I decided to stop. Now I just fear that my tiredness is just a symptom and that it's startig all over again.

jumbled mess/rant? (story + requesting advice idk),"I want to see a doctor to get it clear if I have mild depression or something else. However I find it difficult to do so because I don’t know how much it would cost as I’m not financially stable and the culture and country I live in does not see depression well. 

I overthink everything. I think that’s a main reason why I self-deprecate. Because of that my self-esteem has dropped over the years that I feel I can’t do anything good. I am rethinking my choice of study whether it was a good decision. I don’t think I am fit to become a childcare teacher. I understand that the principal and ‘mentor’ are trying to help my future but negative thoughts just keep entering my mind. I should probably go study something different in university... it’s hard to imagine teaching children anymore. 

I’ve cut down on using instagram because I know it won’t do me any good seeing how others live their lives. Sometimes it just triggers my overthinking whenever I see their posts.

I’ve been told I think too much, that I think for awhile before I reply when this person just wants to hear my honest answer. I think it kind of frustrates/saddens her because she wants me to vocalise my thoughts and feelings instead of bottling up, but I still do. She says she’s a call or text away but it is so difficult to contact her first because I don’t want to bother her with my problems.

Is it possible to survive a breakup having drepression?," I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for the past two years. I became a jerk because of it and my ex left me 6 months ago but she wasn't sure. We haven't seen each other in person since then (it was a long distance relationship, so that was expected).

I tried to become a better person, I started therapy and meds (Lexapro 2 weeks ago). But two days ago she sent me an email telling me she doesn't love me anymore, that she's happy without me as a partner. She also told me to stop sending her messages until I move on, that our relationship is over, but she would like to be friends some day. She sounded so condescending and harsh, she also had depression and anxiety, but she started getting better before leaving me. My hope is gone, she forgot about me so quickly now that she's not depressed when a year ago she told me she could love me forever... I doesn't matter anymore. She sees me as a problem in her past.

I'm so hurt and so desperate rn... I'm stuck with her memories and it's all my fault. 6 months like this. I don't deserve anyone.

depression ruining my relationship and ability to enjoy things unless im distracted or drunk,"I’ve always been depressed. I’m 26 now and I’ve been dating the same girl for 4 years.

Sometimes I love her, i want to marry her, life together, etc.

Other times I imagine myself being happier with someone else. Maybe someone more attractive or with more things in common (note: my gf already quite attractive and we share interests, not necessarily perfectly my type but nobody is).

But I’ve had this with other things. I’m incapable of Happiness unless I am EXTREMELY distracted, or drunk. or both.

when im not distracted, i think about everything. maybe ill never be happy. maybe ill never be skilled enough in my interests and hobbies to satisfy me.

I play competitive games and always want to be on top but its never good enough. when i am working i want to learn everything i can to be successful but it is  ever enough. when im with my gf and start thinking about the “perfect woman”, she is not it. but i mean, nobody is. my ideal “perfect woman” changes all the fucking time, and im not dating a super model anytime soon and even if i was i still would probably find something to criticize about her.

There is something wrong with the way I think. i think? but idk what to do. I’m always overly critical of EVERYTHING. my appearance is never good enough, my work is never good enough, my foreign language skills are never good enough, my gf is never good enough, my rock climbing skills are never good enough, my home is never good enough, my voice is never good enough.

Could you read me?,"Hi everyone. I'm 18. I just entered Reddit,and I don't know how to start but I just need to talk about this because I simply can't talk to anyone around me. The text that I'm about to write is going to be very long so I think many of you will not read. Doesn't matter, I just can't take this to myself anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the things I will describe might disturb some people. I don't even know if I'm allowed to post this. But here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a male, 18 years old (going to 19 next month) and I have been diagnosed with depression for the last three years. At first, I didn't know really what was the reason for my depression (that's why I always recommend people who don't have a actual reason to be depressed to go to therapy and take a deep look into your life. You might find something that was really hidden in your subconsciousness).

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's what I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to tell the story of my life. For some reason, writing it helps me to process my thoughts. And yes, I want people to read it because I'm just terrible expressing myself in real life, and I just want people to know, but I don't have the courage to tell it in person.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. So I was born in Brazil (one of the reasons that I'm writing in English it's because I'm the only one in the family who speaks a little bit of English. So I'm sorry if there's some bad English here). The city that I was born is really violent, which is the reason why my mother wasn't very pleased with the idea of me going to play with other kids in the neighborhood. My father, worked his ass off during the week, but was an alcoholic, and once even tried to kill my mother. Nowadays, he's fine and they're still together. But those days were tough. So, since I was a child I was really close (and sometimes, hyper protected) to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me. My brother is gay, and since always have been very feminine, and we used to play imitating pop singers and famous women. So I start to grew really feminine, but pay attention, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS FEMININE IS BAD. But when I went to school, the thing was not pretty. I spent the years of 4 - 11 being extremely rejected by my male colleagues and being ""accused"" of wanting to be a woman and being gay. Sometimes I was interested in playing soccer like the other boys, but I knew that I would be bullied Everytime I was feminine (which was all the time). And these ""masculine"" activities would always have been a strange thing for me. My father was really interested in soccer, but never talk to me about it and my mother always rejected soccer (just like every other thing my father liked). My brother... Not interested. But I would still play with him of imitate female singers and sometimes, put a fake dress into us. It was pretty much this dynamic until 2010, when I was 9. My brother and I were still playing this, until, in some moment, he started to touch my penis and put my hands on his penis. I'm not gonna lie, I knew something ""wrong"" was happening, but I didn't actually think about it as sex. I didn't even knew what sex was, until the moment that he lay in the couch and put his penis, expecting me to blow it. Obviously, only now I realised that he wanted me to do oral sex on him, but at the time I didn't really know what he was wanting me to do. So I just stand there, paralized and nervously laughing. Later, he went to my front and put his butt in my penis and start dancing with it. I just felt so uncomfortable but couldn't get out, for some reason. I just remember crying hard at that night, just very disturbed. I just remember this fact very recently, with therapy. Since then it was just blocked from my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

At age ten, I didn't wanted to be known as a ""woman"" anymore. But my classmates didn't wanted to accept me as a boy. So I started to become very reclusive. Around that age I discovered horror films. And for the first time, I connected with male figures. It was Michael Myers, Freddy, leatherface. They seem to be treated just like me. And I started to wish to kill my mother. I would play with knives all the time, imagining to be a serial killer. It appeared to be my destiny. Next year, at 11, I receive the shocking news. My mother is pregnant, and the baby is a girl. I was indifferent to the girl until she was born. I'm so ashamed by this but I desired to rape her many times. One day, it was perfect to do it. It was only me and her. It was until I looked to her face. She was just a baby, I couldn't do this to her. I cried so much and I promised to myself that I wouldn't ever cause any harm to that girl. Ever. So I started to repress my admiration for psychopaths, and told myself that I wouldn't ever kill anyone. It seemed like the right thing to do. And it was 

&amp;#x200B;

 When I was 13, I tripped to my grandma's house, just like every year. My cousin, who is one year younger than me, was, probably the only boy I ever know that didn't saw anything wrong with me or that way I was.  Actually, I spent the best times of my childhood playing with him. But at 13, something changed. One day, we were together, watching a film. He started to touch my butt and I was uncomfortable, but somehow, I wanted that. He grabbed me and was trying to have sex. I denied several times but he was being violent, almost stroking me. Somehow I liked the violence. I was enjoying that way he was telling me to shut up. I consent to him so anal sex with me. When the violence was over and started the sex it was awful. It was the most unsatisfying experience I've ever had. I couldn't believed what I just did. I just ruined the only healthy male relationship that I had for a disgusting experience. I still didn't remembered what happened with my brother, but I tried to repress this memory as well. I wasn't successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, at 16, didn't saw any good thing in life anymore, and the memory of the sex that I had with my cousin was still in my mind. In therapy, I accepted that experience but it just seemed that something was wrong. Of course, it was around my whole life so it was very obvious: I'm gay. Right, I'm gay. Mom I'm gay. Dad, I'm gay. World, I'M GAY. Now I'm gonna be happy. Except that I wasn't. So I decided: I'm just gonna be happy when I kiss a man. I kissed. Three. And I hated. Once I kissed a girl, but she humiliated me in front of the whole class and said that was the worse kiss ever. The other girl I was interested rejected me totally. So I just said ""you what, I'm gay. I don't fucking care."" I surrounded myself with gay people, feeling that I would feel part of something for the first time. I didn't. I wasn't interested in any man, except the ones that treated me badly and bullied me. Those one were straight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lived for two years as a gay man, that has never felt so unhappy in my life. Empty. The memory of what happened to me and my brother started to rise inside my head. But neglected it and just said ""it's normal, boys do that"". It was until the last year. when I was making coffee. I accidentally let it fall in my brother's body and, of course, he started screaming with me. At that moment, I just cried like never before. Since I was 10 I didn't cried. And I cried so hard and then hit me. I felt abused. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm going insane. He was only 12 when that happened, but somehow it was a different experience for me and for him. For him, it was just he exploring his sexuality. He continued his life wonderfully as a gay man. Making friends, dating men. And my life just seems ruined forever. But I can't accuse him of having abused me because I know he was only 12. How could I do that with him, when he probably didn't know what he would do with the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't love him. I hate him. Sometimes I wish he was dead. Then I blame myself because I know that if he dies I'm going to feel very guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't know. I don't know if I'm gay, straight, bisexual. God I even have considered the probability that I'm trans, autistic, mental I'll, once I even considerate that I have AIDS. But I don't, I already made blood test.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm becoming insane. Lately I have been considering suicide a lot but... I just can't do this to my sister. She's 7 now and I love her deeply. But, at the same time, if I tell this secret, I might ruin my family forever.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I'm slowly dying. My childhood dreams have disappeared. I have no future. I don't what to do. I don't have friends.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read this entirely. I'm so grateful. I don't know who you are. But I love you.

My breakup is killing me,"Sorry about the melodramatic title, but this really is what it feels like. I'll try to keep this story short, however I could keep on talking for hours and if someone one this sub was willing to have a talk with me by PMs I'd love to because I'm just so incredibly lonely right now.

About a week ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It was a stupid breakup and I feel like my behaviour is the reason for why we broke up, even though she too made plenty of mistakes. When I lost her I once again realized how much she meant to me and that I didn't want to lose her at any costs so I tried to get her back. But all I got were mean-spirited messages saying how she doesn't miss me, she's realized we're incompatible and that she's glad I moved out.

Some days ago I created a tinder profile because I thought it'd help me get over her. Guess what, first evening on tinder I saw her profile. And it fucking killed me inside. The next days, she would routinely put some nice clothes on and leave, while I was stuck in the living room watching her leave to some tinder gate, and it killed me. That's when I realized I had to leave.. so while she was at work I packed up all my stuff and left, leaving her one last voice message that I can't take the situation and that I still want her back. That's when I got her mean-spirited message.

I feel like she was all I had. People I talk to are telling me to distract myself with things that are fun to me, but frankly, I don't know what's fun to me anymore. Watching tv shows? Gaming? Playing the guitar? I feel like watching shows and gaming are just occupational therapy to me. I used to love playing the guitar, at least I think so, but nowadays I feel so fucking bad whenever I play that it's hard to call it fun either. Sports? I've gained some weight so I decided I wanted to lose \~10kg. That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me (in fact, it's kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup). After that, I trained every day, thinking it'd help me lose weight. But in fact, while I lost \~1.5kg within a week, almost half of that was apparently muscle mass. I found out about that yesterday. Now I don't even want to train anymore.

In the last few weeks, I found myself repeatedly contemplating ""passive"" suicide, as in, it wouldn't be so bad if I drove recklessly and that killed me some day, wouldn't it? Now, I feel like I actually want to die. She had issues, and sometimes those issues really annoyed the hell out of me. But who doesn't have those? I feel stupid for losing her and I feel like I won't ever be able to forgive myself. I was ready to marry this girl, but I lost her, due to my own stupidity. I won't ever find another woman like her again, I know that for certain, and I hate myself for it. I would do anything to get back with her, but she has made it clear that she's not interested in me anymore.

Now I know that she will go on tons of tinder dates, kiss other guys, have sex with other guys, maybe in our shared bed and it's killing me inside. Is it jealousy? Purely hormonal? I hope it is because if this feeling goes on, I think I'm actually going to try something. I'm not in therapy, I know I should be, but my depression is making it hard to actually get a therapist. Not to mention that usually you'll have to wait a few months until there's a vacant spot.

Can anybody suggest me something to do so I can get my mind off suicidal thoughts?,"
I have issues with my family, and I don't even know if I have depression, but I feel so much happier when I'm not home, when I'm not around them. I spend 10 hours at school but it doesn't seem to be enough. 

Not only that, I have a big college entrance exam coming up in June so I'm really stressed and every time I fail at something, I feel like a freaking loser and that I should go kill myself. 

I know I should go to the doctor but I can't because as mentioned above, I have issues with my family, especially my mom, plus, mental illnesses or therapy isn't common here (I'm Asian) so the best thing I can do now is to get my mind off negativity by doing stuffs, at least until I can get my own money to go to the doctor myself

I'm at the end of my ropes,"Please don't try to convince me to try more meds or therapy. I've been trying for 12 years to find something that works and I'm just 23. I've also been to different therapists and have tried many types of therapy, the most recent ones being systematic therapy and CBT. Nothing has worked so far. I have stopped looking for a cure, I know it doesn't exist. But I need new ways to cope with my depression because my old coping techniques are no longer working.

I have tried meditation too but seems like it does nothing for me. The only ways I could cope with my depression were doing something creative like painting or drawing and listening to music. I no longer enjoy creating things and listening to music and I've been left without hope because every day I keep getting worse and there's no way for me to cope with my depression anymore.

Relationship possibly costing me my mental health,"Hopefully I don't go too long with ranting and what not so I'll try to keep it short. My GF and I have been in an on/off relationship for 7 years and have been together since highschool. [25M/24F]. Last summer she broke up with me over because she wanted to experience other things which she didn't come up front and said that I just figured. It was an extremely rough month for me after that but slowly got over it. Few months later Over the holidays she decides to try and come back into my life. I tried not to sleep with her for a bit since I knew that's what she wanted at first. Now we're back together but I found out that she slept with what was a close friend over the break up. She also was dating someone off tinder for majority of the break up and all of this is just really fucking me up. I really love this girl and I am trying to move forward since she claims that she loves me and wants to have a future with me. I want all of that as well, it's only been a month since we're trying to work things out again but there are days like these where I don't know if I could let this go. I want to so bad and recently I've been losing myself over this whole situation. I don't know who I am anymore. I feel so many emotions when I get caught up thinking about all the shit she did during the break up. Anyone have any suggestions or advice on this? Please. All is appreciated. (I would go to a relationships subreddit but I'm afraid of negative feedback given there and I'm feeling like I'm legitimately depressed)","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Girlfriend with depression pushes me away,"Hello,
Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a few months now and everything was going good. I could see her love and smile and she was constantly there to either do something or help me. Now I know she had a history of selfharm and depression and I'm not one to change her for what she feels, because I know that's almost impossible in the case of depression. Still I told her that I'm there for here whenever she's in need. 
Yet ever since a week or two ago she started pushing me away and started to cut herself again. Before we started the relationship she told me she would probably push me away and said that she didn't mean for it to happen and was sorry if she would hurt me in any way. To be honest I didn't really think it would be this bad, but that's not the thing that hurts me the most. Personally, as a loved one, I think that seeing your loved one slowly fade away is the most painful part. It feels as if someone took over her body. 
I talked to her about it and I know she still cares about me, because she doesn't want me to feel bad. I told her that I would manage and that I would always be there for here and love her no matter what, but I don't know if I did the right thing or not and would like some advice in how to help her get through this phase. 
Lots of love and respect for all those who deal with this.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Feeling trapped..,"I feel like I’m losing what bit of control I had, and it’s really beginning to show since I’ve become unable to work in the last few weeks because of my epilepsy... I’m starting to become more paranoid, I’m hearing things, I wake up thinking someone is in my apartment, I’m losing weight, I can’t make myself get out of bed or make a phone call. It’s only been a year since I was diagnosed with epilepsy and I think I seriously underestimated how much it was going to hurt my (already not excellent) mental health.

I do my best to maintain myself, but things have been really tough. As things increase in stress, I’m getting closer to a huge episode and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do with myself. My mom sent me some bullshit audiobook about self-help CBT, but any of my half-assed attempts to listen just wear me out or make me frustrated.

My dog is going to die soon (I think) and my family jokes about it.,I’ve had my dog Kai since I was 9 so he’s 11 now I think. He’s basically been my emotional support animal for the past 11 years and I’ve come to rely on him through much of my struggles. My family loves him but doesn’t really like him much. He just smells bad and no one really knows why. So they always joke about him dying even though they know it hurts me. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t know what I’ll do when he dies. I have a therapist but I don’t really have anyone else I confide in about these things besides my wife but she makes jokes too. The last time I had a dog die it almost killed me. We had her while we had Kai. I’ve just not prepared myself for when Kai dies and I’m scared it might shatter me too much.

Am I too demanding? How to deal with cultural differences,"I am a master student that study abroad. I had miscalculation on financial stuff and everyone in my new country is very individualistic. So they told me to find my own way and I got unlucky met some horrible people and I got PTSD for awful events.

Every time I asked people at the university or government what should I do to fix my problem. They told me to find a friend if I could not figure it out by myself.

The problem is most people here don't make a new friend after high school.  

A new friend won't help me to do stuff. I should get a close friend because I keep getting the answer you can use google or I cannot help you. 

I don't like to go to a party or bar. I am too depressed to do fun stuff.

I am tired with a suggestion about joining student association because I did that and I only met students that only want for FWB. And female students mostly busy with their boyfriend.

So I thought I need to find boyfriend too because no one wants to make a new friend.

My psychologist told me to find an online friend. However, when I told my problem to people that I met online in my the new country, most people would reply with, ""You should search people in real life"" or ""You seems put lots of chores to your friend"" or ""You should stop searching for boyfriend"".

I know people my new country is famous for being rude and direct. But I'm still don't know what should I do. I usually only ask like translation or things like guidance if I have a certain condition.

Does anyone else punch themselves as a way of self harm?,"Every once in awhile I’ll punch myself in the face when a very intense bout of depression sets in. Usually it’s when someone starts talking in depth about sex and relationships, and the magic surrounding it. It’s therapeutic and part of myself thinks I should be punished. I guess I can’t really express my emotions either because people will find it too dramatic and silly, as I have been told before. No one takes my emotions seriously. 

I’m too afraid to cut my wrists and the endorphin rush from the punches feels so good afterwards, but it hurts and my face swells up. I make sure not to hit my jaw. I feel like it’s the only way I can calm down. Everything feels so smooth after I’m done. 

I’ll only do this every so often though, it’s not consistent but I think I might start doing it again.

I told them I was overwhelming as a person because I’m so depressed and negative and that they would want to be done and they would stop coming over when I needed help. I was told however “don’t worry I won’t ever leave you alone”  but as I had expected I was right and now they are giving up. I am beyond angered and sad and frustrated that I put all of my trust 100% into this person who even has told me to open up to the rest of that group. But now the whole group has a slight fear of me because depression is scary even for people who aren’t actually depressed because they just don’t know what to do sometimes. I am no longer treated the same by the rest of the group and the one I trusted with everything has left me in complete shambles and my mind is freaking out. I am not really sure how to deal with this stuff because I don’t have much time to do things or the energy to do much for myself. Any suggestions on how to sort my head or at the very least I don’t know just acknowledging that I’m doomed as always would be great. Or just you know the whole yeah people suck nobody can be trusted everyone lies and nobody could ever handle the worthless person you are. Because that’s what my head tells me right now.,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Being suicidal and scared to die,"So for as long as I can remember I have been depressed, I don't mean that in the ""oh yeah I've been sad for a while"" I mean I was first formally diagnosed with clinical depression at age 6 in 1997.

I like to joke that it's my longest lasting relationship.

So what brings me to write this post?

I've been in a horrendous depressive episode for the last 18 months (over my live I've been depressed all but 6 years, but it comes and goes in waves) steadily it's been getting worse and worse, becoming suicidal, secluding myself, and all the other lovely things that go with it.

I want to die, I don't want to be here anymore, and before you suggest medication, I've been on every medication for depression also multiple for anxiety and a couple antipsychotic meds too. 

Counselling has never worked for me, I stopped doing illicit drugs years ago stopped smoking, stopped drinking, tried exercise and diets. 

Yet, I still have suicidal thoughts and feelings everyday, all day, and night. I wake up sad that I have woken up.
I go to sleep hoping that I have stroke or heart attack that kills me in my sleep.

I've planned my suicide so many times and in so many different ways, (I have attempted suicide a few times in the past).

Now to the crux of my problem, I want to die, but I'm scared of actually being dead.

Any thoughts or suggestions will be welcome.

Thanks.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

I don't feel like a real person,"I've been feeling better but I still feel like I'm not a person and that I shouldn't expect the good things that happen to others to happen to me, because I'm not one of them. I try and pretend really hard to be a real person but I know I'm pretending. I don't get happy or excited, I'm not motivated by passion or enjoyment. I don't have those feelings. 

I'm looking to feel as distant from my hopelessness as I can, but that doesn't mean I'm happy, just less hopeless. I feel like I should limit my impact on real people as much as I can, and not get in the way of them being happy. I feel like this world is created for real people and I just slipped through by accident, and as long as I don't get in the way they will tolerate me when I'm with them. 

I feel like they can see me pretending, and they know I'm not real, but they go along with it because of how pathetic I am, and they don't want to feel bad for showing me that I'm not real.

I know that this perspective is not reality, but that's how it feels. I've never met another not real person, I feel very alone

I'm not in danger, I got past that a few months ago. I finally asked for help about 6 months ago after hiding it for 10 years. I don't really know how to talk about or think about the way I feel, and I'm trying to figure that out.

I'm posting it hear because my next therapy session isn't for another 2 weeks and I don't really know what to do with this. I wanted to ask if anyone has felt this way and eventually not, because I don't know what it's like not to feel like this. 

I can't imagine living like this and being happy.

Awful nightmares and bad sleep,"
So I’ve (23f) been diagnosed with depression since 18. Meds only semi work and i have a few people i know i can count on as support but over the last couple months I’ve been experiencing extreme night terrors. 

What makes them worse is how realistic they feel, as I’m sort of semi conscious when they happen. It makes it harder for me to distinguish what’s real and what isn’t. Someone im incredibly close to saw me have one, apparently i was crying and thrashing like crazy and when i finally snapped out of it i was a mess for ages even as they held me and tried to bring me back from the horrible head space i was in. It’s made me reluctant to sleep as I live at home with parents and sleep alone and when it happens i end up getting no sleep as I’m terrified of it happening again so won’t  try to go back to sleep.

I’ve tried adapting the mentality of ‘suck it up’ and forcing myself back to bed after it happens when I’m on my own but I struggle to get out of that head space and still lose a good hour or so of sleep before i finally feel comfortable enough to sleep. I was wondering if there’s anything i can do when im on my own to calm and ground myself quicker after it happens?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Will it ever go away? (Self Harm/ suidical thoughts-- Trigger warning!),"Will it ever go away? I thought that I beat this sh\*t, but what happened last night said otherwise. I have suffering from depression for a whole year! It started last year, 2 semesters ago, with it being compounded with ADHD led to an emotional devastation. It had gotten so bad that I would self harm everynight using an absurdly sharp keys to scratch my upper right arm (I am a lefty) and one night I decided to cut myself three times using scissors. During that semester I would often write (I wrote like Da vinci to make it harder for others to read!) things about the emotional pain and that I wanted to die.

Trapped in my thoughts,"I'm stuck in my own depressed thoughts to the point where I can't sleep. I was so happy today at work, I had a conversation with the cute new guy, I had conversations with customers. The only bad thing that happened to me today was my annoying manager but she's annoying everyday.

As soon as I got home I started to get stuck in my thoughts again. The people I thought were friends don't hang out with me anymore. I'm anti social, alone and have no one to talk to. I want to get into a relationship but all I do is cry all the time, nobody wants a depressing crybaby. Even my grades are dropping not because I can't understand the material but because my bedroom is a dark unproductive place.

I just sit here and cry all the time, I'm even crying right now. But I have no one to talk to or no where to go. I can't stay after school and I don't know how to make friends. Even if I did they would leave me because I'm always depressed.

Is it all even worth it?,"Just to start it off, I DO NOT WANT TO KILL MYSELF. But recently I've just been overwhelmed and I don't have anyone with whom I could share this. So basically before the winter break(week ago) everything was going great. I went on a friendly ""date"" with my crush that went well, my engineering contest was going great (my biggest dream is to get into MIT and I am capable) and school was fine. Fast forward to a few days ago when it all started going to shit. My crush left for a ski trip and gone cold, don't know if I did something wrong (I have Asperger's and I'm a typical stereotypical nerd, aka no dating skills, basically I don't pick up on the subtle hints at all) or is it just the trip, I can't stop thinking about it and her, it's very hard for me to find girls that I would call compatible, basically someone with a deep passion for something that basically defines them. That makes me distracted from my work which stresses me out even more. The contest I'm taking part in is also kinda collapsing and I'm very worried that I'll loose thousands of hours of CAD work and 500$ (in my currency 1500) that I invested into the project that I was promised back. Another team posted pictures that made me really anxious because of their complexity compared to the other teams and given their perfect score they might win. And the school part, my homeroom teacher that basically told me that he doesn't give a shit about me or my goals and that my reasons for joining this contest are wrong and that it's all my fault that it's gone to shit and that I'm a tyrant who takes away all the work from my teammates which is totally false because they haven't done a thing and basically don't care, anything I proposed I was told to do myself and most of the tasks of the other teammates also ""partially"" fell on me, like: ""Hey can you help him with that?"" It got so bad that I had to get outside help which made my teacher even more mad so he started insulting me straight to my face, as well as behind my back, saying he doesn't want anything to do with me and basically disrespect my entire work and from my schoolmates tell me he is quite proud of it, it got to the point where my parent had to go and talk with the school. (I wanted to press charges) More fun news came when all of our sponsors pulled out before we could sign a contract with them so we got no money ATM so basically I'm getting shit at school invested 10x time than anybody in the project as well as the 1500 that I may not get back, also possibly severe lung issues. And now I'm on vacation and I feel helpless since I can't get anything done here and I feel like I don't deserve it and that it's not the time for R&amp;R when the project is going critical, I also need this because MIT looks at stuff like that, it's a very prestigious and demanding STEM contest.

And right now I just feel empty, unloved, alone, anxious, stressed and hopeless, I have to be happy or otherwise my family will be mad at me for ruining the holidays which puts even more pressure on me. I had a similar situation already a few years ago(choosing a school) where I got close to attempting to take my own life, took me 2 years to recover, I made myself a promise that it would not repeat with MIT and now I feel like it might happen and that I will be left with nothing and alone, just an empty shell devoid of happiness and any hope for tomorrow.

I'm requesting support but I have no idea what could help me rn.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

What do I say to him?,"What do I say to him?

My (26F) brother (23M) attempted yesterday. Thankfully he was not successful. He called to say goodbye and tell me the he loved me. He did the same to some friends and left a note for my parents. This was a very serious attempt. He has had a lot of exceptional stressors lately in addition to the fact that he has been suffering from depression since 2018. He drove a car at 90mph into a telephone pole. Thankfully, he is getting help now and will be getting voluntary inpatient treatment until further necessary. 

I’m going to see him on Monday. What do I say? What do I do?

I don’t want to make it all about me when I see him. I’m angry, scared, and very sad about this. I’m planning to get therapy for myself to cope with the anger, trust issues, and overwhelming sadness that comes with this event.

Advice on handling negative thoughts and depression,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for sources of information/books to read/videos to watch to help me overcome my depression. 

I've had a lot of negative thoughts in my head for a very long time. Usually involving self hatred and a strong feeling that I'm unworthy of care, love and affection. It's definitely hurt my relations with those around me and has affected my moods and ability to function. More recently, I've experienced severe depression (from the end of last year), that culminated in me attempting to end it all in early February. 

I really want to try and get better but I keep finding myself slipping and the huge amount of self loathing comes back in a massive wave. I don't really have any close friends to talk about this with, although at the university I'm really fortunate to have access to an affordable psychologist who I can see once in a while. 

I'd like to try different techniques to help me progress and get healthy and any advice on how to do this or what to read would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading :)","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Does online therapy work? / existing is just bad, isn't it?","I've been going to therapy for a while now and I'm currently taking medication (I see both a psychiatrist and a psychologist), but it seems like nothing is changing. In fact, things actually seem to be getting worse. My psychologist is very kind and smart, but she doesn't know what to do with me anymore. I have things I know I have to work through, but I'm not able to talk about them, most of the time because I am ashamed and fear the judgement, even though I am aware that she is a professional and is there to help. I keep withholding information from her. 

So I've been thinking about trying online therapy. Just writing down my thoughts and sharing them with a professional I don't have to face. I think I have avoidant personality disorder, and that's why I am struggling so much with getting the help I need.

When is it enough?,"(F26) I am a person having my own struggles with depression and anxiety and lately panic attacks.

I've suffered from anxiety and depression for years now, but when I graduated university last summer things just spiralled out of control to the point where I was put on anti depressants again and my doctor told me I wasn't fit for work. The anti depressants have helped with my depression but my anxiety is still that bad that doing anything but sitting in my room is a massive struggle.

I'm running out of things to say when friends and family ask if I've got a job, so this is a nightmare situation especially as the only person who's not a professional who knows is my mum. And it's all well and good trying to focus on getting better but I've been trying for many years now and haven't made much progress, recently I've been trying mindfullness and working out but neither has helped much (I also start counselling again next week but this has never helped much either).

Abuse, sexual assault, violence, suicide, self harm, NSFW, and addiction is all mentioned. Tread with care. ._.

Just a little background; I am an 18 year old pre-everything FTM in high school. I live with my parents and my disabled younger brother. 

I almost attempted suicide last night, I guess. A friend talked me through it and helped me fall asleep, but now that I'm awake all the feelings have just come back. I have been ""casually suicidal"" for like, 2 years at this point and have attempted suicide twice  before. The thing is, I really don't want to die. I just want it all to stop hurting. It's just that nothing I've found so far can make it stop hurting.

I'd just.. really like some advice about where to turn now, that's all. And maybe some validation or support.

A lot of things have happened over the course of my life, and it gets really long. So like I said, I'll add another TL;DR at the end, but here are the events that have lead up to now, listed neatly in chronological order. I have a lot of memory gaps, which I assume is a defense mechanism against trauma, so I will try my best.

Before I was born, my parents (who had met at 12 and 13, and are still married at 41 and 42) were severely abusive to each other. Physical fights, using weapons or objects to harm each other, severe emotional abuse. My mom tells me about a time she kicked my dad down the stairs 3 times while he was drunk, just for fun, and laughed at him each time. She laughed about it as she told the story despite the mortified look on my face. I swear, there's something wrong with her. Both of my parents had really bad home lives growing up, apparently, but my dad especially.

Anyway, my dad was an alcoholic troublemaker who always ended up in juvy, or eventually jail. My mom was some sort of sick twisted bitch or whatever. She ended up in jail pretty often, too. The physical fights stopped after I was born, my dad stopped drinking, and my both parents became law abiding citizens. Occasionally they would throw things at each other, and they still get in screaming matches, but it's nothing like it was before I existed.

I was born a really ""gifted"" kid; 157 IQ (I know it doesn't matter), really good at everything, scary type of smart, extremely mature for my age. The only thing I wasn't good at (and still am not good at, lol) was prolonged physical activity.

My mom has emotionally abused for my entire life using this fact. She has essentially turned me into a perfectionist and led me to believe that it was my fault, and not hers. She has never accepted anything less than straight A's and perfection, but instead of punishing me like a normal kid (grounding or no allowance or more chores), she would scream at me until she was blue in the face and occasionally beat or shove or throw me, yelling about how I was a disappointment and a failure to her. She emotionally neglected me as well; she never paid attention to me or gave me praise unless I was doing something that  she wanted me to do. She knows nothing about me, and ""loves"" the image of me she has made. She says I am a waste of money, and makes me feel guilty for needing basic things like food and health care. (We are pretty poor, but I think that is overstepping the line.) She vicariously lives her life through me because she ruined her life at my age; she stayed with my dad and dropped out of college to have me at 22.
This is only a summary of the things she does. It would be much worse if I went into detail.

Nothing I do makes me feel good enough.

I am severely fucked up because of my mom. I have no idea how to maintain healthy relationships, whether it be with friends or romantic partners. I have no self esteem, no self respect, and if I'm honest? I have no personality or sense of self, either. I live with an overlying sense of guilt that I am at fault and that I deserve to be hurt, or worse. I have no hobbies and no interests, and never have. I do not enjoy anything I do in the slightest. To cope with not feeling anything, I have (kinda) reckless sex, hurt myself, and binge drink. I also occasionally smoke weed. The way my mom has treated me has ended up with me being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). After a hospitalization at 15, I was diagnosed with adolescent borderline personality disorder, so I have had it for a while now. Several therapists said I showed all traits by the age of 13 but couldn't diagnose me because of my young age.


Anyways, moving on.


So firstly, I'm living with completely untreated BPD. The nearest specialist is an hour and a half away, and I have really bad insurance. My disability checks were taken away when I turned 18 last year, and my mom gets mad at me when I try to call to ask to fix this. My life is a living hell. I feel nothing at all, but at the same time, I feel everything at once. There is a void that I can't fill no matter how hard I try and I'm in agony. Suicide is always on my mind, every hour of every day. I hurt myself often and binge drink to deal with the stress, or occasionally have reckless unsafe sex or smoke pot.

When I was first brought to therapy, my therapist and psychiatrist had evaluated me for autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, and tried to refer me to a specialist. My mom screamed in his face that her perfect child could never be autistic. I have never been evaluated again, but have talked to my school counselor. She says I'm most likely living with untreated ADHD or autism spectrum disorder, but most MOST likely both at once. (My brother, who is emotionally and intellectually disabled, has both of these. So does my dad. It's in my genetics.) I have a hard time focusing on or doing anything, whether it be school or things outside of school. This includes hobbies or being with friends. My grades are piss poor right now, which adds to my guilt and depression. I want to do my work and make my teachers proud, but I haven't been able to focus on/understand the lessons and I lose all of my stuff a lot.

Around the age of 11 or 12, I developed severe anxiety and panic attacks. I was constantly in a state of such anxiety that almost anything could set off a panic attack. I would hyperventilate and cry until I threw up, and would occasionally shit my pants in fear. I was also severely depressed; I had no energy or motivation to do anything. I would hurt myself every day. Around this time I also realized that I had gender dysphoria and was bisexual. I told my mom about all of this, because as a 12 year old you're  supposed to go to your mom about your problems. She shamed me, she blamed me, she screamed at me. I had to threaten to hurt and kill myself to get her to do anything to help me. My panic attacks have since tapered off, and I don't have them as often now.

However, my mom thinks I am not trans and that I am straight. I suppressed both my gender and sexuality for years, but my gender dysphoria has come back tenfold. I'm too scared to tell her but.. I can't live as a woman.

My grades have been pretty not great since 9th grade. I'm really smart still, I just have a really hard time paying attention in class and am too depressed to do my assignments. With enough effort (not much) I can pull A's in most of my classes, and at the  very worst a low B, but nowadays, I don't have the energy to put out that effort anymore. I'm looking at a solid D in every class I have.

I unfortunately have attempted suicide twice. My mom got really angry at me both times and didn't console me in any way. Just blamed me.

I live with constant guilt. Whenever I make a mistake, I hurt myself. Consciously or not. I have scars up and down my arms and all over my fingers from stress-picking, and my shoulders and thighs and stomach are covered in self-harm scars. It does not matter if it's a big mistake or a small mistake. I cannot deal with the guilt of fucking up even a little bit, so I hurt myself to punish myself. It's the only thing that makes me feel a little better when I fuck up.

I have been sexually abused 3 times.

The first instance started at the age of 10 and ended at the age of around 12. My childhood best friend had started acting really strangely, cutting me off for no reason and telling me he hated me and treating me like shit. Essentially, we made a trade; I get to stay friends with him if I send him videos and pictures of myself. He never told me why he started acting this way.

The second time was the worst one. There is serious background to this. I made a new best friend in 4th grade, and we have been super close ever since. We had a mutual crush on each other for years. In 9th grade, I couldn't handle the stress anymore, and set my suicide date as New Years 2017. By some stroke of luck, my best friend invited me to an Xbox party and talked to me all night long and distracted me from killing myself, and we confessed our feelings for each other that night and started dating on January 4th, 2017, during my 9th grade year. We have been together ever since. However, in 10th grade, he admitted to me that he had a fat fetish. I was mortified; I was pretty overweight back then from stress eating, and had no self esteem, but I tried it out because I loved him.

It was horrible. I told him we needed to stop doing that, and that I was going to get fit and lose weight. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldn't love me anymore. I was terrified of being abandoned by the love of my life, and sex was the only form of intimacy I knew at this point, so I didn't want to lose the only things I cared about. I kept doing it for him. It would make me cry and have panic attacks and occasionally throw up, but he didn't stop. I kept telling him that it was okay because I didn't want him to leave me.

I developed severe anorexia because of this. I haven't told anyone about it because I don't want professionals to get rid of it. It's a comfort for me; I need to be as skinny as possible. I cannot be fat or I will kill myself. (I also don't have time to be hospitalized for something like this right now. I am in the midst of scholarship applications and making money for college.)

Now that I am skinny, I am severely paranoid that he loves me less and doesn't like the way that I look. He has admitted both of those things. When he's in a bad mood, he'll insult me about how I'm not sexually good enough for him anymore and that my body is ugly because I'm so skinny. I don't feel good enough, because I clearly am not. He reassures me that he still loves me personality and my face but frankly that's really shitty, if you ask me.

The fat fetish thing doesn't happen anymore, but I'm not good enough for him now.

I'm too scared to leave though. He has been my best friend for like, a decade. I don't want to lose what we've had. This is the biggest problem I face right now aside from the abuse I endure from my mom. This is the reason I had attempted suicide, both times. 

I was drugged and violently raped at a party by one of my friends at 16 while everyone was sleeping. I don't really want to talk about that one. It was just rape, I guess. Uncomfortable situation. It was the least emotionally taxing of the three, though.

I have C-PTSD. I have nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, episodes of dissociation. I throw up or have an episode when people touch me in the wrong places, especially my stomach.

The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I have a beloved ferret named Slinky, and he wouldn't understand where I went if I died. He needs me.

I don't want to live like this anymore, but I don't want to die. No treatment I have gone through has ever worked for me. I have been on 3 different SSRIs so far (Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro) and none of them have put a dent in my mood. I have also been on Lamictal, a mood stabilizer. It didn't do anything, and they kept upping the dosage. I had to taper off of it because it was too much for my body to handle, and I would throw it up. I have been kicked out of several facilities for not responding to treatment in any way.

Fortunately, I make a little bit of money. I sell art and I work at my grandfather's gas station down the road.

TL;DR
Mom abused and neglected me to the point of not knowing how to function as a person, I have been sexually abused 3 times which resulted in an eating disorder, I am so mentally ill that I am in agony every day. I have untreated BPD, ADHD, C-PTSD and possibly autism. I have severe anxiety and depression that no treatment can put a dent in. I have been kicked out of several facilities for being completely unresponsive to treatment. I am transgender (FTM), pre-everything, in an unsafe environment, and drowning in dysphoria. I live with so much misdirected guilt from everything that the only things I think about are hurting or killing myself.
And I have to go to college this year.

"My boyfriend is depressed, I want to help the right way","Hi, so I'm not sure if I'm right here, but my boyfriend is having a severe depression since he is maybe 14. He is getting help since one year and takes serious dose of medication. We've known each other since eight month. He is lovely, he is just the right guy for me and in my eyes he is perfect. He actually is always tired, in this state most of you probably know, but I think he is getting a little better. 
Only he has those phases where you just feel nothing and at the same time kind of despair and don't have any self-worth and I can't find the right words really. I hope you know what I mean. Well I don't know what to do. I always offer him to talk to me and say what he currently is feeling, only if he wants to of course, but he just says that since it is the same thing every time he just needs to get through it. I don't know if that is good for his mental state this believe, because I think he thinks he is troubling me by talking about this, but it is not. I have told him that I will listen even if it is the same thing every time and that he does NOT waste my time! Still I feel really helpless if he is in this state of mind and I'm not even sure if I should say anything. And if you guys can tell me if there is anything you would like someone to say, do for you when you are in this state of mind, could you tell me? Maybe that will help me to say the right words, or show him my support the right way or that I should just leave him pass through it.. 

I of course realise that everyone in their depression is different and that there is not *the* right way, still maybe it helps.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve lost track of my life and I don’t know how to get it back,"RANT/REQUESTING SUPPORT OR ADVICE 

I’ve (24F) been struggling with depression off and on for the past 6 years. My mood was getting better since I broke up with my ex-boyfriend a month ago, but recently I feel like I’ve lost track of my life completely. 
The break-up was the fist time I choose my own needs above someone else’s and it felt like a step towards freedom. Meanwhile I’m kinda dating somebody I have an extremely strong connection with. We’ve had a short but intense relationship in the past but lost connection. We started talking again right before I finally decided to breakup with my ex (I’ve considered it many times but never had the courage to actually do it). I strongly believe that talking to this person made me decide to breakup with my ex. Besides that it really feels/felt like the universe wanted us to connect again in a romantic way. We’ve been dating for the past 2,5 weeks and I’ve never been this confused in my life.
One day I feel so liberated, loved, happy and absolutely in love with the person I’m dating. The next day I’m full of guilt, confused about my feelings for my ex and extremely depressed again. Guilt because I feel like I’ve done my ex wrong while I know I didn’t. Our relationship was not equal and mainly based on me taking care of him financially and emotionally. I feel like I abandoned him and I hate myself for that. Confused because I miss him so much and still feel love for him and the person I’m currently dating, both in a romantic way. Depressed because I don’t know how to deal with these feelings and because I think I messed up again. I feel like my life is a constant pattern of failure and making bad decisions unconsciously. I’m stuck and lost. 
I keep telling myself that the most important thing is to be happy on your own, that you don’t need a significant other to be happy. I know I tend to start difficult and ambiguous relationships in order to avoid other complicated feelings I actually have to deal with (like a breakup). I’m very aware of my coping but at the same time I feel like I genuinely need to experience if a relationship with the person I’m dating will work out or not. I’m pretty sure I will be devastated if it doesn’t but that doesn’t keep me from trying. 
Altogether the main feelings I’m struggling with is being depressed and confused. I’m very aware of everything that’s happening but at the same time I’ve no idea what’s going on (mainly emotionally). I can’t function properly, I sleep a lot and have no appetite. I only feel energetic when I’m with somebody else but when I’m alone I just feel physically and emotionally drained. There’s so much going on in my head that I just end up with an empty and zombiefied mind. My anxiety is getting worse and I have nightmares every night. I don’t see the meaning or function of life because it never seems to get better. I’m not suicidal but I’m just done with this constant sequence of negative events and emotions. I just want to live a happy and stable life. 

I don’t know what I feel, I don’t know what to do to make me feel better and I don’t know which decision was/is right or wrong.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
depression is making me F[15] flunk out of high school,"I F(15) have always been a super academic student athlete, getting high 80s and 90s throughout middle school and into about halfway through ninth grade, when the depression started to kick in. it wasn’t as bad as it is now, but my grades started to get significantly lower.

This school year (tenth grade) my academics are horrendous. I have failed math in 2/3 terms (51 first term, dropped into 40s for 2nd term) and my science grade was in the mid 60s for term 1 and i think i failed term 2. 

I have no motivation to bring myself to do anything anymore. I can barely leave my bed. I am a competitive dancer and have always been super passionate and serious about it, and now i just don’t care any anymore. 

My dad who has been apart of my whole life (but not really at the same time because he’s a drunk a*sh*le) is in critical condition and is dying. I don’t know if it’s because of the emotional trauma and physical abuse he has caused me throughout the years, but i also feel numb to him dying. i feel like i won’t even give a shit when he’s gone and i know that sounds absolutely awful but i seriously don’t feel anything 

I honestly have no idea how to deal with this right now, because my mom doesn’t really believe i’m depressed and won’t take me to a therapist. I know 10th grade is the most important year for math and science academics where i live and i honestly feel like it’s too late to fix anything. now i can’t help but think i’m going to flunk out of high school and end up working at a gas station for the rest of my life 

someone please give me some sort of direction or guidance on what i could possibly do because i feel really lost and confused right now, and i’m terrified about my future with my poor academics right now

I unhealthily use my phone in my bed for things I probably find boring, like a zombie, too the point where I still use it when I get tired.

I also have sofas in my shared kitchen, with a TV, and 3 flatmates, though I'm hesitant to interact with them. And, I obviously have the outside world.

The things I've tried is buying a cushion for my chair, and using one of those hand resistance things that's just a tool for fiddling that can't really be conveniently used in bed while on my phone.

What’s a strong response I can have to this asshole please!!,"What’s a strong response I can have to this please?

Me: I’ve had 2 people saying depression is an excuse to be lazy in the last 2 days

Asshole: it genuinely is 😂😂😂😂

Me: ?!?!?! EDUCATE YOURSELF

I’m so angry. This disgusts me! What can I say please I want my response to be strong enough to be effective! Xx

Straight after he said that the vilest girl at my school requested to follow me and the boy messaged me again saying “listen speak to (girls name) 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣” 

She is scary that girl. She has come at me more than once online because she is a bully and thinks she is powerful and volunteers to help people like this boy. It’s like when I was bullied severely. They used to get other people involved. I’ve never even spoken to this girl in person in my whole life, I don’t know her and she doesn’t know me.

I need something strong to say because I have to educate this kid and have something very strong to say.

"Successful, but what is the point?","I'm not sure what to do, so I'm writing here. I am nearly 50 years old, and a nurse in a management position currently pursuing a higher degree. I've been with my husband 30 years and we have grown children. By all accounts, I'm successful. Life isn't perfect but it could be - and has been - worse. Much worse. But every day I can't shake the feeling that I just don't want to live. I've had depression probably since high school, and it worsened during different life events, but nothing severe is happening now. During the worst of times, I didn't feel this strongly about life just being completely meaningless and, really... what the hell is the point?  It's exhausting.  I'm finding myself just ""stuck"" at work, unable to be as productive as I need to be. But I'm doing well in my college courses - straight As. And actually, I started pursuing a higher degree to give myself something else in my life - something that would help me not feel so hopeless, but oh boy has it NOT worked.

I have been to counseling before, and it helped during that situation, but I honestly don't see how it will help me now. Before I started the college courses, I had found myself looking up how to hang myself on a doorknob. I know the warning signs of suicide - I'm a nurse! I scared myself. So I started college. Now I'm two semesters in, and just the other day I was considering how I could kill myself and make it look like an accident so my family wouldn't have to live with my suicide.

Yet earlier today, I was laughing so hard I couldn't even tell the story about something funny my dogs did last night.  It's amazing to me that I can be this absolutely hopeless, yet still laugh like that.

My motivation has completely disappeared and I'm feeling overwhelmed by having so much to do.,"So I'm 27, and a single mom for the last year to 2 &amp; 6 yr olds. I'm currently a sahm working remotely for a few hours a week, going to be starting school online next month, and I will be looking for a job that provides more for my family. 
The trouble is I've been battling post partum anxiety and depression since i had my last little one. So just a little more than 2 years. 

My depression had improved greatly in the last few months but recently it's been fluctuating again (I was sick for 2 weeks and now my kids are both sick as well as my roommate) this has made things very difficult and I've had a lot of health problems at the end of last year that made it difficult to get important things done. 
Well, now I've reached a point where I have zero motivation. I just feel so overwhelmed by everything I have to get done and even making a to do list, and today sending it to my LDR partner with the idea that he will check at the end of the day to see how much I accomplished has done nothing except make me feel more depressed and anxious. 

I'm having trouble thinking, I've stopped eating properly and making sure to drink water every day (my SO has been helping to encourage me to do these things properly) and I'm just having trouble making myself focus and chill out enough to get things done. 

Today I was going to do things... but then I had kids screaming and crying all day and I couldnt do hardly anything. Now it's the end of the day, I've managed to eat and drink water today (more water than usual but not enough yet) and I'm just feeling really sick again. I dont know if its stress or if I'm just burnt out or what it is. This might not even make any sense because I'm having trouble thinking. 

I hate that I cant get myself motivated and actually accomplish things. I hate that I cant do better. I just feel like complete shit.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

"How do you, not only keep existing, but actually be productive, when you're depressed everyday?","As someone who has chronic, but still functioning depression, it's been a real struggle to be productive and better myself while I'm depressed, which, unfortunately, is practically everyday for me. 

I usually do the bare minimum: going to work, making myself look put together, etc. But, tasks outside of that tend to fall by the wayside, and I notice that I'm not bettering myself or my future. 

I have looked this up before, (i.e. how to do things when you're depressed) and usually I come across articles that explain how to get basic things done and reminding the reader that the small stuff is important too. 

While I really appreciate this sentiment, I want to know, how do I not only exist with my depression, but also flourish? Like, doing things that will favor me in the long run? 

What do other people with depression do? Maybe some success stories would be helpful? 

(also, a side note- I'm currently being medically treated for depression, so I'm not really looking for specifically medical advice)

Hello I need some advice about this.,"Hello, I have been dating my girlfriend for a while now.

She has been dealing with depression most of her life. She bravely decided first semester of freshman year of college of last year to go to therapy. She is also doing her best to recover from self harm.I dont know her exact severity but the college has her on a watchlist. She really wants to change but has trouble getting out of the mentality she has grown up with for so long. She has planned to take her life but from what I can gather she has postponed it. To quote her: ""You [referring me] will never know I'm gone if I did"" meaning she wouldnt tell anyone. At night when she is alone is when she feels the most depressed, to the point where sometimes she has become a nihilist and only wants her death. I understand that it's all up to her to change and her suicidal tendencies dont mean she doesnt love me. Unfortunately due to our situations we became long distance partners. However, I have done what I think is good support. My questions that I have are:

What can I do to better support her?
Is there some things that I need to say or do to better support her?

Feel free to ask more to get a better gauge on the situation. I'd appreciate if you guys want to discuss deeper into it though if we do, could it be through private messaging as I wouldnt want the comments to be filled with so much info. 

Thank you so much for listening.

Depression is getting a lot worse,"So a bit of background, I've struggled with mental health since a very young age. I've been in therapy several times, and have been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds for 3 years. 

I've always thought my depression was situational, and I've worked really hard to change my life for the better. The past 6-12 months have been the best I've ever felt, as such I made the decision to start trying to come off my anti-depressants. My GP advised to take the pill on alternative nights which I've been doing for the past few weeks.

However this past week my depression has came back a lot worse, and I'm really struggling with urges to hurt myself.

I think I’m helpless.,"I am a 19 year old female who has been struggling with depression since I was about 9 or 10. When I started college this past fall, I thought I’d get a new start. It went well for the first couple of weeks, but as time went on, my depression took away my chance of making something out of my life.

I want to go to the doctor about depression,"I'll spare the backstory, but after 15 years of feeling mostly bad and two attempts at counselling (therapy) I'm prepared to give medication a go.

I'm not sure how to talk to a doctor about this; I REALLY don't want to be seen as an attention-seeker and I have a habit of playing-down how I feel (you get real *good* at acting over 15 years). I'm in Wales in the UK by the way if that helps. I rarely got to the doctor about actual health issues since it's so difficult to get an appointment and you only get to say about three words during your speedy 5-minute slot with a doctor who you've never seen before (ugh, it's kinda free so I should stop moaning).

Last time I spoke to my mom about it (sparing some details- I've never told her about feeling suicidal and self-harm I do) she just said I'm probably feeling down because I had a lot of work to do at uni and I have a cold :/

I've exhausted the other options. I hate having to 'seek help' because men aren't supposed to show emotions. Every single piece of depression info online just *has* to make sure they tell you that ""dEpReSsIoN iS mOrE cOmMoN iN wOmEn"". Thanks for that.

I just hope they suggest medication. My two experiences with therapy weren't good- I just desparately wanted to tell someone my whole story. All of it. I want someone who will listen to me for once. Instead I found it so hard to say anything personal or really true, sitting in horrible little rooms full of Buddha statues and pictures of sunsets being glared at by the therapist for getting upset while she sits there scribbling down notes you never get to see and and looking at the clock so she get get on to the next gulible sucker who pays £40 for 50 minutes of spilling personal information.

Therapist Reached Out,"I see a trauma therapist for PTSD/C-PTSD, and recently I encountered two other traumas which have put me over the edge at times. They know that I haven't been doing the greatest while trying to deal with them and that I'm continuing to spiral downwards. I usually send a weekly message to my therapist to let them in on the skills I'm using and how my week has been.

I haven't been up for sending messages lately, and I probably scared the crap out of my T last session as I discussed how much I hated having the intense suicidal ideation and how detailed it's becoming. I even blew up in their face telling them that they didn't understand how serious I was. I could even hear her start to choke up as rarely do I talk to her in this manner. Today, she sent out a message to let me know how she could help me throughout the week. I'm very confused as I have no idea how a therapist can help anyone through the week. I truly appreciate the message of concern, but how can I ask my T for help during the week without it crossing boundaries? I know for sure she's not going to bring me food or allow me to call her, so what does help look like as I know I could use some? 😪","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Is it possible to date if I'm depressed?,"
I've been diagnosed in the end of 2018, but I honestly can't remember a time in my life where I haven't been sad (although it gets better at times).

So
I recently started dating my best friend and it's been all good. He's really understanding, supportive, has been there for me in my darkest times and things happened so naturally for us that it just felt right. 
But sometimes, I can't feel things as intensely as him and that makes me feel really bad. Like, I know I love him but there are days where I just can't find the motivation to do anything and it feels like my feelings get kinda blocked, so when he starts being affectionate towards me or something, I'm just there like... yeah.
We have talked about this a few times, but sometimes I'm afraid I'll never feel things again and it'll get impossible for us to handle and I really don't wanna be a burden for him.

I’m sorry for another dramatic rant lmao,"sorry if this is going to be annoying and stupid. you don’t have to read this random rant ahah

i(F16) struggle with depression and anxiety in addition to some other mental disorders. i have the kindest friends in the whole universe. my parents pay for my therapist and my psychiatrist. i come from a quite privileged family. plus my school kindly allowed me to have an easier program than the rest of the school after i ended up at a mental hospital. 

however despite only studying 4 subjects i am failing all of them. most of the time i don’t have energy to do anything, so i just watch Netflix. my homework keeps piling up and it gets more and more overwhelming. i become too anxious to face my teachers and my classmates, so i decide to stay at home. this leads to me feeling extremely guilty. i feel like a disappointment :c 
i don’t deserve any of the support and i’m just wasting everybody’s time ehzhzhhsh

whenever i catch up with my 4 classes i tend to think « everything is going to be alright from now on » but i always end up in the same place. in my room, in my bed. feeling like a burden and feeling like i will never accomplish anything.

do i drop out of school?? do i get a job? i’m way too tired to do anything :0 

anyways thank you so much for reading this. sending love and support to all of you &lt;3","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Exercising and sadness,"Hi im new here, 
last year i tried to end my life around this date and the support equip at the hospital  told me to exercise regularly to help with the sadness, since i wasnt diagnosed depression or nothing really, just very sad. This is important becuse no one told me that before.
 And since then i tried to be more active, got a bike thanks to a job with my aunt and started walking for playing pokemon go again etc. But whenever i stop those activities i feel very low and sad, even if i do it just because im busy, but i have to admit sometimes i feel very lazy and tired to do them. 
Is there a connection between exercise and feeling happier? Can i find a way to be more excited about doing them alone/with friends?

How do I help my girlfriend,"My girlfriend (27) has slowly been sinking into depression, and I have no clue as to how I can help her. 

These last few months have been tough on her especially the last two. Her parents have started talking about divorce and it's beginning to get ugly between them. Her mother calls her and vents about it and it usually leaves her angry. Her brother who has recently moved out of their parents house in January was just put in a psych ward for evaluation because his schizophrenia and paranoia have gotten the better of him since he's moved out. This is his second time being admitted. My girlfriend had a tremendous amount of pressure put on her for the last couple months from her parents to watch over him since they live out of town. Since he's been admitted her depression has crept up on her. She's doesn't want to do anything but sleep and cry. I'm always there by her side but do give her space for her self so that I'm not overbearing on her. Lately she's been going on about how she wishes she could just end it all and kill herself because all her pain would go away and it would be easier. This isn't the first time she's said something along these lines. She's never tried to hurt herself in that sort of way, but it does concern me. She's been visiting a therapist lately and it seems to help her a bit but it's only been her 3rd session, and she hasn't completely opened up on the subject with her. This morning she texted me that I haven't been giving her the ""attention she needs""despite being with her and doing everything for her when I come home from work. Im trying really hard to help lift t her spirits and nothing picks her up. Even the dates we try to have do help. Half way through she wants to call it a night so she can go home to sleep and lay down. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I love her to pieces and want the girl I fell in love with back but I don't know how to get her out of this funk.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

Please help me,"I am so tired of all. I dont know how long I can keep fighting. Sorry for the vent but i have nobody to talk to.

Background: I am a 30yo woman with diagnosed endometriosis, adenomyosis and possible chronic fatigue sindrom. I always had period problems, I had a lot of problems and fatigue the last two years but the last six months the pain and fatigue have skyrocketed making me unable to work or study outside home. 

I am a Spanish migrant living in Belgium with my partner, struggling to learn flemish and to feel that I belong here. I cant rely on my parents (abusive father + mum that wont defend me). I still habe a couple of friends but they are tired of hearing my complaints.

...

I got depressed three years ago after a lot of bad luck with jobs/studies. With some therapy and antidepressants I finally got better. Last year i was feeling much better to the point where I improved a lot in my flemish skills and found a job gardening. 

Then my other diseases hitted hard and I needed to quit the job because I was to weak to do it. I went back to school to learn more flemish. I managed to pass a course despite all the pain and fatigue and missing a lot of clases. My teacher cant stand that I do well without going to all the clases and she told me that she wanted to fail me but as I had a 7/10 the secretary didnt allowed it. The next course she had a easy solution. She refused to let me do the last exams. As technically I 'failed' the course not doing the last exams she could finally fail me. The secretary didnt help me at all.

Now I sit at home in daily pain seeing how all my hopes for the future are going down the drain. 

...

My GP didnt believe in my symptoms and was two years ignoring them. I just changed to a new one. She (the new GP) knows that I am diagnosed with two chronic painful diseases but she refused to give me any painkillers because 'just a paracetamol should be enough'. I still need to wait a whole month to be able to visit my gyn, the only person that seems to care about my pain. So I am at home with no painkillers, in daily pain and so weak that folding the laundry makes me pant from the effort.

I kept going to the same therapist but she is clearly not prepared to deal with chronic pain. I told her three times that i have daily suicidal thoughts and she just changes topic, she wont adress it. Also she gives me stupid advice that is incompatible with my diseases. In our last session she told me that I should consider working as a gardener again. How? Doing basic housechores is a nightmare for me, how I am suposed to do an incredibly physical job???? I am not going back...

Then its the issue with my money. As I didnt had a job (except the few months gardening) in three years I barely have any money left (I spent my savings doing a Master before coming ti Belgium). I cant sustain myself and I am compeltely dependent on my partner. I tried aplying for disability but as a migrant not only I dont have any right to get help but the social worker told me that if I dont find a job in two years (when my status is reviewed) I will likely be kicked out of Belgium. I will become a homeless person. To apply for any help in Spain I ""just"" need to work 12 months....

And then there is the issue with my partner. He 'loves' me and tries to suport me. But he really doesnt want to hear about my pain or depression, I cant talk to him about anything that worries me. He simply doesnt care. He also refuses to do any house chores. He forces his SICK girlfriend to do all housechores (walking the dog, cleaning, cooking, laundry, gardening, garbage...). He doesnt care that I am in pain or sick, he will simply not help me.In normal circumptances I would leave such a sexist man but like I said I dont have money anymore and I would be homeless.

...

I am struggling so bad with suicidal toughts. They are there in my brain every day, either wishing to kill myself (like today) or just fantasizing about a car or another disease killing me.

I cant kill myself because 'my boyfrirnd loves me so much'. I dont want to risk him getting depressed.

But I am completely alone. Nobody (partner, therapist not even my GP) cares about me or my wellbeing. Why should I stay in daily agony and missery just to not hurt others?

How can I get used to the idea that from now on I will just be a crippled house wife with no future, no job, no friends, no proper medical care and no suport.

I can't get out of bed.,"If this sounds familiar, please share your tips/success stories. I need all the advice I can get.

I don't have any friends. I work a dead end job because I don't have any valuable skills. I don't have any hobbies, though I've attempted lots of things, only to lose interest. All I do besides work is binge eat and watch Netflix. I do have a loving husband who wants to help me, but doesn't know how.

How do others find energy to continue.,"I just feel so hopeless and numb been contemplating suicide more or less daily the last 5 years atleast. Pushing 30 hate my job, really hard finding a new one and once I do my employer sabotages my references and since there is an abundance of applicants like 200 for every job in my area they simply choose another one.

Skilled craftsman in a field no longer required started my own company in highschool which went great for a few years until it didnt. Took my current shitty job to pay the bills, tried going back to college and working at the same time to avoid student loan but during my second year the depression really hit me and I dropped out and the last two years have been a constant struggle to come back mentally. I don't really enjoy anything anymore the only thing that keeps my mind occupied on more positive thoughts is spending a couple hours every day at the gym but even that is starting to diminish in effect. Pretty much isolated myself socially since I just feel worse trying to hang out with my friends.

How do others find the energy to continue trying to improve their life with constant failure and rejections?

I have no one. Living in my own for the first time. And I have no one to talk to.,"Ive moved out on my own under extreme circumstances. So in about August of last year my family and I were evicted from our apartment. My sister is off and married and my brother stayed back in Idaho to finish high school. My mother and I moved to Virginia because my aunt had a house they were paying for but werent living in. And we lived there until January. My aunt is now getting a divorce for leaving her church. And her husband lost his second job. So the house couldnt be payed for and was a liquid asset. My mom had been applying for Disability since shes been the victim of domestic violence with all 3 of her marriges. But since we barely moved to Virgina everything was still based in Idaho. Food Stamps, Medicaid, and goverment records and stuff. So she needed to move back to Idaho and quick. But it took us a month to get to Virginia and cost $3000. We sold our car. So the whole time in virginia I payed for internet, phone plans, and storage back in Idaho with a job at Mcdonald's with no transportation. So we couldnt afford a move back. But a wonderful old friend of my moms back in Idaho that had been housing my brother this whole time decided to pay for a plane ticket back to Idaho for my mom and house her too. So she paid for that and my mom just barely paid her back with tax returns. But right before my mom left I moved to a different town in Virginia I decided to save her money by living on my own with the money I had saved. It has been good for 2 months rent. I had to quit since I didnt have a car and I start a new job tomorrow. But Idk if I'll make enough money for next months rent in time... I realize I'm all over the place. But mainly I'm on my own. Ever single member of my family is cross country. And I had to leave them all under extreme circumstances. I'm homesick and scared of going homeless. I just want some comfort. Ive been alone for a month and a half. Ive cried a lot lately which isnt normal of me and not a lot has made me smile. I'm not suicidal at all. But I just want someone to hold me you know? Sorry if this is too much to read. I doubt anyone will see it either. But hopefully someone does. I could use some help.

Will the fatigue from Citalopram go away?,"I have been on Citalopram for five weeks. The first three weeks I was on 10mg, the last two weeks I've been on 20mg. On 10mg, I felt tired in the morning, but it got better throughout the day. This lasted for the first week, then I stopped experiencing fatigue. Since switching to 20mg, I've been feeling even worse fatigue that barely gets better throughout the day. When can I expect this fatigue to start improving? Has anyone had luck switching to taking Citalopram in the evening? I'm currently taking it in the morning...

Spring break is coming up in a week. Would it be worth it to wait it out and see if the fatigue goes away, or should I use that time to start a different AD? I've heard that Citalopram can be a sedating AD.

What should I be doing to get out of this..I am a solo warrior and I am sure I can beat it.,"I am slipping into a very dangerous world **(again)** where I am kind of staying alone and having recurrent episodes of going to my dreaded balcony. I am coping by taking a shot of diazepam and whisky.

It’s gone to the point that now I can barely sleep in a week easily for more than 4 hours a night and I am constantly fighting people all around. If I don’t have someone around I get delusional that I am at fault and this constant self-loathing and a sense of not having done enough is driving me crazy to the point that I think I am worthless.

I am also professionally undergoing a transition to a new role and in between, I fought with a lot of my close buds and a couple of my relatives and this is now showing on my face and I can barely smile now.

This is a sad state of affairs and I am now seeking professional counselling online with people who have undergone this.

I think I fucked up quite bad this time and I really need someone to talk to. Friends who I thought would understand have kind of given up on my constant emotional outbursts and I have now shut myself in.

I had a really rough start to this year and things have been very bad at home and I have been all solo on this and I have got myself into situations where I have been super drunk and tried to OD on any tablet I could find.

Strangely in my office environment, I come across as pretty normal but sadly ….I don’t know this is so fuckin messed up that now I can’t even reach out to anyone at home and here in this foreign country.

What is my best action plan? Any ideas—no I don’t want to go to doc as this is just 16 days to pass before I go back to my home country and I am kind of reserved to again open up.

Meditation doesn’t help. I am also having random episodes of night terrors and recently I have started drifting into a weird halo..

I have even called one of my friends to come over and he doesn’t have any idea what’s happening for 4 days just to have someone around to ensure I don’t fuck up anything.

My family doesn’t have any clue and I intend to keep it that way..

Please whoever has coped with this alone…DO TELL ME…

Looked in the mirror,"I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I’ll give you some backstory:

I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people’s expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I’m now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don’t know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I’ve never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it’s driving me up a wall.


2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven’t done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn’t hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It’s fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad.  


Any thoughts would be great because I’m so lost rn.

I can't handle sexualization double standards,"So, I happen to be a gay dude. And, I think I am going insane from not knowing how to handle the fact that males in media are never ever allowed to be sexualized the same ways females are all the time.  


Males showing off their ass and legs, wearing thongs or tights or fetishizing impractical clothes designed for the purpose of being fetishizing with skin-revealing stuff, and have them pose in compromising positions... that's never ever allowed. Yet, it happens with female characters all the damn time.  


I am 32 years old, and been speaking openly about this for many, MANY years. I've had all sorts of explanations being told for why this is the case. And no matter how much it's explained to me, it still pisses me off we don't get exceptions from the rules.  


I got most recently triggered by this today. I was sitting with some other dudes, and they happen to be straight. Suddenly, one of them starts a Youtube music video on the TV in front of us, and it's one where tons of females are oversexualized, while NONE of the males are at all sexualized. I pointed it out, and the dude playing it first says I should ignore that and focus on the music. I said I can't. He then said he's sure there's stuff like that with dudes as well. I said I have been looking for it and never ever found anything. He then said I should be at least happy for HIM for getting this. At that point, I just broke and had to leave.  


I hate how I can't let go of this obsession. I hate not being able to just let it go and be happy. But a part of me doesn't want to let it go, because the double standard is driving me insane and makes it feel like only heterosexual dudes deserves being catered to.

Terrible heavy physical pain in my chest when I’m sad.

i want it all to end,"Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down.

I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore.

My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family.

My mom is depressed and I don't know how to help her,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here so let me know if this this isn't the right place.

&amp;#x200B;

My (20F) mom (58F) has been depressed, to some degree, for as long as I can remember. We're a pretty sad family all together honestly, but that's all I've known from them. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some backstory: My dad (61M) fixed up my grandparent's old house (the one my mom grew up in) over the course of a few years. The old house was falling apart, and my dad wanted a new place to renovate before he got too old to do so. My mom never wanted to move in, but reluctantly agreed once my dad pointed out the benefits. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, a year after we move in, after all the garage sales and selling the old house, getting rid of sentimental items we couldn't keep and all the junk we didn't want.  And she's spiraling, guys. I've always been her person to vent to, since I've been alive. And every night she tells me just how tired she is, of everything. How she misses the old house that they spent over 30 years in, how she hates every tiny thing my dad does, just blaming him for everything. She cried into my arms tonight asking what she has to look forward to everyday, to just tell her something good in her life to look forward to. And no matter what I said she would just cry harder. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do to help her, if anything. I know my dad isn't going to help because they argue just about every day and haven't got along in  like.. 15 years. My mom doesn't have many friends either, just her sister and some people she cleans houses for. Is there anything I can do to help her on the bad days?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Everything fell apart after a failed business and a failed psyche. Figuring out next steps.,"26m I had pretty moderate social anxiety through high school and college ultimately fueling depression. Went to get treatment before senior year of college, threw me on Zoloft and Klonopin. Helped a bit and was doing okay, graduated with great grades despite issues, information systems and marketing undergrad. Had a pleathora of random skills across the board mostly in the real of web-dev and design, used to be passionate about photography but all passions have fallen off lately.

Started a freelance drone services business out of undergrad (despite not understanding just how much student debt I was in....in my name $60,000, in my parents name another ungodly amount...further fueling depression). Still living with parents in hope of hitting it big with the business. Things started off slowly so I went into an MBA program on the weekends while working on the business during the week. Psychiatrist put me on adhd meds too which helped. Graduated 2017 from that, business wasn't making any profit still, mainly breaking even- didn't start off with any real capital so I was bootstrapping. Was still doped up on meds so I was still hopeful and disregarded the fact I wasn't making any real money.

2018 really nasty suicidal depression starts kicking in along with cognitive side effects and deteriorating memory. Business still breaking even, though halfway through the year almost landed a huge deal that would've put me way in the green. Came soooo close but then everything fell apart. Psychiatrist leaves the state halfway through the year and have to find a new one. New one takes me off klonopin too fast and takes away my adhd med and I'm left like a deer in headlights for 6 months in a state of psychotic withdrawal unable to answer texts, emails or phone calls...couldn't even leave the house. Psych didn't care and made me suffer through it. Business fizzled out, wasn't making any money, trying to recover at home. 6 months later things started getting a little better, started tapering my way off Zoloft slowly.

Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September. Continued the Zoloft taper, and was okay until I began reaching the lower doses and as the winter kicked in the depression and suicidal ideation began to really kick my ass again. The job isn't in the field I want, I'm spending most of the pay paying off credit cards I was using for the business.

Now I'm 6 months in to the low paying IT job, with 6 figures worth of student debt to pay off, stuck at home with no savings (parents have no savings and are financially irresponsible...I blame myself but partly blame them for letting me take out so much to go to school when I could've gone to a great local state school with my grades.). I'm near NYC so that's where I've been applying to a bunch of jobs but with basically no luck, apparently my degrees are worthless. I'm still in a very anxious state and don't think I'll continue my Zoloft taper for a while, honestly I'm about as anxious as I was back during the klonopin withdrawal. I could reach out to alumni from my school but I hesitate based on my current state of affairs. The depression plagues me a bit more lately, and I can't tell but I think the IT job may even be adding to my depression. It's relatively easy and keeps me out of the house and around guys my age which is nice.

I think the years of being on Klonopin and Zoloft are really taking a toll on my mind as I try to get off. I can't think original thoughts, it's just the same thing every single day, like a nightmare groundhog day. I appreciate anyone who took time to read through this post, really struggling to figure out my next steps, feel like I've been stuck in the same headspace of suffering for a year and a half now. I keep telling myself the same story and it doesn't get me anywhere. Thing is this story seems to be the only thought stuck on replay every day. Just how different things could've been. How I'm the only one I know who's ever faced this level of mental deterioration.

Reflecting on it now I realize the victim mentality may be playing a large part in this but the suffering continues with not much of an end in sight, just dwindling hope. I know my first step is to try to address this depression but it keeps outrunning my attempts.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

"Questions for people who were haunted with regret with fucking up with a girl years ago/failing to find someone new to make you feel the same way/better. Right in this moment, when you are feeling haunted, what are some effective things to tell yourself to shake this off?","Fucked up with 18 year old girl who liked me when I was 18. I was very attracted to her and was filled with all sorts of the bonding/chemicals and emotions of an 18 year old. Thinking about her voice or what it was like when she was near me still gives me chills.  A bit less than 10 years from that now, I'm getting back into dating and trying to find someone who can give new experiences/better experiences and put these feelings of regret/being haunted to rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a bit hard to forgive myself for fucking up with her. And hard to face the possibility that I may have missed a once in a lifetime opportunity/thinking things are downhill from here on. Hopefully those thoughts prove to be false but it doesn't help that the feeling of presence and her voice seem to be much better/more intense than with people I can be with now... for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

By haunted, this is what I mean: sometimes in my daydreaming, I'll see images of her that feel very real, almost like she's in the same room with me and I feel some strong chemicals/emotions. I feel an intense feeling of longing and hate for myself/reality that I didn't pull through almost ten years ago. **In this exact moment, I'm trying to think of some good mental strategies to shake this off and avoid the depression that follows it.

Help -self harmed for the first time,"Throwaway account. Background: I'm 16 and have struggled with moderate to severe depression for about a year now. It came out of the blue, although I've had anxiety for a while. Depression runs strongly in my family so not altogether surprised.  I've struggled so much with lethargy, apathy, hopelessness, imposter syndrome and feeling like people think I'm better than I am, and generally feeling like a useless human. I still love myself and always will, but I've started to really doubt my capabilities and I'm not sure how much of what my brain tells me are actually lies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, last night I had a breakdown and was really struggling to communicate how I was feeling to my parents. I know they love me, but I don't think they entirely understand what's going on for me. My mom was trying to get me to exercise to combat the depression but my body felt like a bag of rocks and I just didn't have any willpower left so I just refused. So my mom got super angry and eventually I just collapsed in the bathroom. I don't know what made me do it, but I ran to my room with these really sharp tweezers and cut up my legs and made them bleed. I counted and it seems there are about 40 scratches that bled, plus a zillion more before it got more intense

&amp;#x200B;

That's the first time I've ever hurt myself on purpose, and now I'm scared that I might do it again. Because the pain felt good, it burned and the adrenaline rush felt like a drug and I didn't feel so passive anymore. But now that I have my thinking/feeling brain back I feel guilty and I'm afraid that having done it once means I could easily do it again. Because I don't feel like it was really me that did it, it was like my depression monster climbed out and possessed me, and that could happen again. What should I do? Has anyone else experienced this and have advice? I'm honestly kind of scared, now that I know what I'm capable of. I never thought I'd be the kind of person to self harm","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

As of recently, I’ve noticed I’ve been having a lot more breakdowns than I usually have. These have gotten to the point where I’ve begun to push the important people out of my life. 
On the flip side, I don’t do anything with my life. Besides the global quarantine we currently have due to COVID, I just.... do nothing.

"I feel like no one understands me, and it makes me incredibly lonely","When I was in school, I thought it would get better in my 20s. I’m now approaching 30, but I’m still not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

I tried to understand others, to listen to their problems without judgement, and to give advice (when asked). I’ve been told that I’m a good listener and a good friend. But when I need someone to talk to, no one seems to understand. Sometimes I am ignored, other times I am misinterpreted and even criticised. The more I try, the more I am misunderstood, and the more I feel frustrated.

I tried to improve myself, to read books, to try to think more rationally, and to communicate more clearly, so that others can understand me better. But after years of trying, it still seems fruitless.

I hate going out to parties, where everyone talks over each other, and no one listens. The more I socialise, the lonelier I feel.

It’s no one’s fault, really. I have a sensitive temperament that makes me a bit out of sync, a little hard for others to understand, I know that. I can’t change who I am, nor can I change other people. But this doesn’t make the pain go away.

I can feel myself changing over time, becoming more cynical, more critical, and less trustful. I know how counter-productive it is, but I don’t know how else to cope.

On some days I feel like wanting to end all of this somehow. I just came out of a bad depression, where I spent entire days in bed and even had suicidal thoughts… I’m feeling a little better now.

I’m thinking of going to therapy, but I’m hesitant because of the virus going around.

I’m also thinking of moving to another city and start over (after the virus ends of course), but I’m not sure if this would help. I’d hate to waste so much effort just to end up back at the same place.

I guess I’m just looking for is some advice from people who have personally been through something similar… what worked for you? how did things improve?

"Some guys on reddit may have location info for ""nudes"" I posted and I am so close to ending it","Long story short, I had anorexia and needed some body positivity. So, I uploaded images to flickr, turned **off** 'share exif data' feature, and posted a before and after pic of my body, which ended up being a lot of chubby pics of me (completely clothed but bikini). I was horrified to find out some scary captions were appearing and I could see it was being fetishized, which was not my intent really, I just wanted to feel better about myself because I've felt like shit lately. 240\~ people viewed it and it was reposted to a sub for fat girls by another account, which was my mistake for putting the link on reddit where it could be crossposted in the first place. My exif data contained my location and phone, but I'm not sure what else... I'm terrified that they have my location data or serial number (not sure if possible). I contacted Flickr and they CONFIRMED there was a glitch that showed my exif data.

However, even so, seeing as I live in a college dorm, is there really any cause for worry if they have my phone model and location, if this is 5K miles from my real house, and the photo was not entirely sexual? I'm deeply horrified and have had a panic attack all day. There were maybe 20 photos of me. You couldn't see my face or head or anything other than bust.

How much should I be worrying about this? Photos were deleted and I am still in contact with flickr... but if a goddamn photo with my body and location is captioned ""i wanna X sexual thing"" im freaking tf out.

The Pharmacy is out of generics. And have tons of namebrands but because of how scripts are worded may or may not end up faxing and or calling the doctors? OO

Then my fucking insurance is also having a meltdown not because of wording. But price differences. Are you Effing Kiding me?!

When the world is falling apart these assholes want to nitpick and what gamers call rule lawyer between 'dueluxtine' vs Cymbalta? the fuck is wrong with them?

And anyone have some experience getting them on the same page? why the hell now of all fucking times would it matter? I seriusly don't recall it making a difference before the epidemic.  A few times they'd be out of generics and I'd get a nifty bottle with Cymbalta (for example) .

The current situation has caused a HUGE setback,"Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. 

A bit of background: I'm a California girl in my 50's. And, I've struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. I've got a claim for SSDI, but apparently I'm not sick enough. SMH   I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldn't breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight.

I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. I'm not ashamed to say I was Daddy's Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband.

So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. 

Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid-19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my mother-in-law for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed.
I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, I'll never go hungry. So since I'm disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is $50/month. I also had internet shut off because I couldn't pay them (just $50 too. My needs are small) I've had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities.

 And, well, I've run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didn't happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I don't know how to ask for help, or people just don't care. Let's add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. I've heard that the economic stimulus package won't pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because $1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a ""shelter in place"" order. I have asthma pretty badly, so I'm party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldn't go out. Same with my mother-in-law.

My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just ""be happy."" I've never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. 

So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. (I'm typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post) My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my mother-in-law's place so I could download some movies. It's really exasperating to be so helpless, and so tired of my f**ked up life, and so sad, and no real prospects in paying my measly $100/month bills. And when I reach out, it either goes sideways or I am ignored. I can't eat or I get very nauseous (die to my anxiety and a medical issue with my stomach.

Why don't I deserve the help I really need? I literally have nothing to live for. And I don't know what to do.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

She told me she wants to marry me, she wants to be with forever...

I bought her a ring and wanted to surprise her but the next thing I know was that she cheated on me...

Everything reminds me of her, I can't do something without crying, without imagining they say I love you to each other...

Breaking up gave me depression.. and I want to speak my mind.. please be nice.,"I did not think I would end up this way. Drowning in self-pity in my room creating a post on Reddit because I can't express how I feel to anyone. I'm just hoping this venting post could make me feel slightly better. I'm not looking for pity, I just needed to speak out my mind.

It was a 4-year relationship, I broke up December 2019, Its been months. I've done all I can, move to a new country, try a new sport, meet new people, and many more. I can't say that things did not get better in time, because it did. Time heals all. It helped me move on and lose most of my feelings for her, but it left a pretty nasty scar on me. So if time heals, what's the problem??

I don't wanna be a whiny prick, because we all go through breakups, and my situation is certainly not harder than anyone's situation in this world. I just need a place where I can speak out my mind and not be judged. I dated a girl that I idolized, I see her for the angel that shes not. I was blinded by my feelings, and I see that now. Don't get me wrong, she was wonderful, loving, caring, and it just didn't work out.

Around August 2019, we moved from our hometown to different countries for University (We started an LDR). After our 4th year of dating, she started changing. I'd like to believe that it was the people that she surrounded herself within University because I have never seen her act this way. When November 2019 came, she started doing something that ruined me. She would go out drinking and kept it from me, she also started ghosting me for days. I was not used to being ghosted because, throughout our 4 years of dating, she has never done that. And really, being ghosted by her ruined me so much. I started getting panic attacks. Initially, It was once every two weeks, then it became once a week, then it became 2-3 times a week. Eventually, she broke it off in December 2019.

Moving on to January, I moved to a new country, a new city, a new environment, and things seemed like everything was fresh. I had the fresh start that I was craving for. But things didn't go as well as I expected. I got depressed, alone and so far away? I didn't have anyone to open up to, and a PHYSICAL connection with anyone. I did not have any friends in this new country. I started to open up a habit that I have locked away a long time ago, I started cutting. I cut myself when I was a kid so that my parents would notice, and signal to them that I'm not ok. But this time, I cut myself in a place where no one could ever see, my shoulders. So what's my motive? The motive was weird, but it worked. First of all, it calmed me in the midst of an anxiety attack. It took all the anxiety away in an instant. Secondly, If I was a ""self-harmer"", then no one will ever accept me for the person I am. (I know I'm wrong, but it worked). Yes, I was lying to myself, but at least I was not stressing on why I did not have friends like other teenagers. As if I was ""forced"" to live alone because of my lifestyle.

It was my sanctuary for a month, my cuts started to get deeper. I woke up one day and realized how badly scarred my shoulder was. My bedsheets were constantly covered in blood, my pillow, my trashcan is filled with blooded tissues. At a point, my cuts weren't healing properly because I would cut across the cuts and left nasty scars on my shoulder. I couldn't continue. Even though It helped me, I don't want these scars to stay forever. I needed to stop before it's too late.

So, I stopped hurting myself only for the fear of creating new scars. I turned to religion for answers, I have been blessed to receive answers, I know 100% that this is all going to blow over, and the sun will shine on me once more. But sadly, it did not take the pain away. The pain is very real and I was trying to numb it with WHATEVER helps.

I did not write this to blame my ex. I have read and searched for answers to know that, this isn't her fault. I shouldn't blame her for making a call that I couldn't make. I could've walked away when the signs came out, but I didn't. Yes, she caused the initial heartbreak, but I am 100% responsible for the actions I have taken upon myself, and how I treat myself post-breakup. It took months for me to realize this, but it doesn't make things easier.

I am still looking for ways to keep moving on with my life and try to be the best version of myself. I see clearly now because the clouds that have clouded my judgment had disappeared. It's somewhat amazing to see how far I have gone, yet scared of what's going to come. I have seen so many things from this depressing perspective, and I am not satisfied with the person I am. No one really knows what drove her away. Nonetheless, I aspire to be a better person in many ways. I aspire to be better in terms of mental health, relationship with God, and my character.

This crazy experience in my life has taught me to appreciate loved ones, parents in particular. Only when God takes away someone that I care about, I realize how lucky I am to have loving parents and supportive high-school friends that have kept in touch with me through this tough time. Yes, they can help me, but they can only do so much. I don't revolve around their life because they have their responsibilities and commitments. However, at the end of the day, I know that I am responsible for my happiness and I have to drag myself to the place I want to be.

This break up has been a roller coaster, there are days that I feel like I'm getting better, and there are days like today, where I feel like this will never stop. Hopefully, I will get through this soon and live my best life.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
I’m lonely and depressed,"So I was off on a youth volunteer program, located across the country.  We would have been traveling to a second place, which didn’t happen.  I was in a house with 10 youth from around Canada, who started off as strangers.  We were living together for 2 1/2 months before we were sent home, which was halfway through the programme.

I met some of my best friends.  We have plans in over a year to do a road trip across the country.  But I won’t see them until then, as we live so far apart from each other.  I loved the time we all had together.  There were ups and downs, but I got a lot from the experience.  I’m generally quite shy, so it was amazing to be surrounded by people, socializing 24/7.  I definitely came out of my shell.  We would stay up late, and all sleep in the same room.  We would wake up, and have breakfast together.  Anytime I felt like going out for a walk, I always had friends around to join me.  We smoked weed many nights together, watched movies, and made food late at night.  It was what I always felt like I was missing, not having any siblings who I had this relationship with.  Anytime I was feeling a bit off, my friends were there to talk to me about it.

Also, I was independent.  I could do what I wanted and be who I wanted to be.  I wasn’t being told by my parents how to behave, or being judged by a group of friends from home who I act a certain way around.  I came into the programme as myself, and only myself.  I didn’t have to act a certain way to fit in with a group of friends, or act a certain way at home to please my parents.  Don’t get me wrong, I love my parents.  But I’m at the time of my life (17M, btw) where I want that freedom.  I want to explore who I can be.

We were supposed to travel other places, and fly to a different part of the country to spend the second half of the trip.  Then we got quarantined.  Then we were sent home.  My friend and I who happened to be on two flights took some edibles before.  We had to leave at 3:30, so we didn’t bother sleeping before we went to the airport.  These edibles hit HARD.  Once I got to the gate we’d be waiting at, I was paranoid.  There was people around.  These people might have COVID-19.  The seat I’m sitting on might have COVID-19.  I can’t escape it.  It is everywhere.  Whenever I heard someone cough, it felt like an impending bioweapon.  But I was trapped in this airport and couldn’t avoid it.  I had a mini-panic attack in the washroom.  

I got on the flight, and it was surreal.  I hasn’t really processed things yet.  But I started to drift off to sleep, and saw myself at the house we were staying, with everyone in my volunteer group around.  Then I woke up.  And the whole world came rushing into me.  I was on a flight.  I was leaving.  I was going home.  I might not see some of those people ever again.  My volunteer program experience was now in the past, and I couldn’t change that.  I wanted to cry.  It’s not like I even really LIKED everyone in my group.  But after spending almost three months living with them, I was still attached to them.  And it was hard to leave that behind.

After a blurry ~14 hours, I finally got to my home airport.  My parents met me there and picked me up.  I told them how things went, but it’s impossible to really communicate my experience.  I got home, but realized I wasn’t really home.  Things were different.  Society has morphed into a nightmare-like dystopia.  I’m not even allowed to see all my friends.  How has the world changed so quickly?

I was able to go out and see two of my friends.  We played basketball, and it was pretty fun.  I told them about how my trip was, and shared a few stories.  But it was weird.  These used to be who “my friends” were.  They’re still some of my best friends, of course, but now I have OTHER friends, who I consider to be almost as close.  And with these other friends, I have plans in the future to go on a road trip across the country with.  It’s weird knowing that I know have other close friends, who my best friends don’t even know.  And it was weird coming back home, seeing my friends, and knowing that I don’t even want to be here.  I want to be back with my youth volunteer group.  My friends were really happy I was back, but I can’t possibly feel the same way under these circumstances.  I’m NOT happy to be back.  I don’t WANT to be here.  My life is so depressing now.

Almost every moment since I’ve been back, I’ve felt like I’ve suffered.  Sometimes, for brief moments, something has made me feel happy.  And I’ve felt content for that moment.  But then I remember my current situation, and it feels like a pang to my stomach.  I feel like I can’t escape this world of misery.  I know that COVID-19 will blow over, I’ll have a good summer with my friends here.  And next year, I’ll go on a road trip with my good friends from the programme.  But right now I just feel empty.  What am I gonna do for the next few months?  I wasn’t even supposed to be here.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I need help with a routine,"so I have been battling depression since my teen years, but I have a good grip on it most of the time and take precaution. Due to recent events, I can feel my depression knocking at the door. I am actively searching therapy and medication. But I really need advice on a routine for me. I feel like this post is such a cry for help just screaming “someone teach me how to be a functioning human” lol but like. I just feel like because I’m depressed I take so long getting ready in the mornings, I move so slow and have so many things to do. So sometimes I just avoid getting ready and it’s honestly gross.

I don’t feel like I’m enough and I need help,"Since the age of like 11 I would often get waves of depression and anxiety suddenly. I’m mostly fine for a majority of the time and after each “wave” I try to pick myself up and go on like nothing happened, but anything either I or anyone else does could get me back down the same rabbit hole of wanting to die. My current theory is it stems from stress related issues caused by a dysfunctional household earlier in my life because of my parent’s divorce. (It was rather messy, mostly because of my father). With these “waves” of depression I often find myself getting very paranoid that people are speaking about me behind my back and that everyone hates me. I also start to believe that I’m absolutely worthless and a pile of living garbage. I get really distant from my friends and family and my immediate reaction is to block them on all social media’s and not talk or look at them. Lastly, while these waves happen with no pattern that I could sense I always seem to carry this guilt and shame of my past which leads to my almost always sad behavior. If anyone has any advice please help, I’m so tired and I have no hope.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
How should I do this 'homework' from a therapist,"Hello,

I am struggling with some pieces of 'homework' between sessions that the counsellor has given me. These are the tasks:

1.) Call my friends and tell them how I feel.

2.) Ask 10 people to describe me in three words.

I'm struggling with both of these because:

* I'm a 26-year-old man. I was not brought up to have - much less talk about - feelings. Sure, trying to break that sounds great in theory but one of my friend group tried that a year or two ago and none of us knew what to say or do at all. We felt so awkward and just left it. Some of our friend group just said this guy had had a few bad days and was blowing it out of proportion- not nasty but none of us know how to handle it. Family are out of the question sadly as they always become very angry with me for mentioning feelings
* Telling friends I feel bad during a coronavirus pandemic is *incredibly* selfish- we've all got problems
* It would also be proving them right- they've been hassling me contsantly to come home (even though it'd be illegal to socialise with them in person anyway RN, so kinda pointless). I've told them I feel better away from my parents for a bit longer, plus I can work on an essay I'm writing for uni. I live in a student area and students don't seem to be panic-buying like other groups, so i just feel more comfortable here. Saying I feel bad (despite feeling this way for 15 years-ish) would just increase their feelings that I ought to move in with the parents. I'm vehenmently against this
* I know it sounds like I'm being critical and just shitting on the counsellor's ideas, but I don't think I'm going to be able ot do these tasks
* I'm worried about disappointing the counsellor. We've had two sessions and at the end of each he has asked me what I found most useful and because I'm not really sure what to say I just say the first thing that comes to mind. We talked for 20 minutes about problems I've had about my appearance and being bullied for being ugly for aroun 15 years now and he seemed to think by the end of the conversation that I was healed. Some of what he said maybe will help, but I still have a long way to go (just FYI I'm not expecting counselling to 'cure' me I just need strategies and I desperately just want someone to share stuff with)
* I'm struggling with a lot of the tasks during sessions too- last time I had to fill in a picture of a flower- one positive thing I could do instead of being depressed (it's a choice?) in each petal. I tried hard to overcome the immense \*cringe\* I wanted to react with but I just feel like I'm being picky.
* He said for the second task to tell the people I ask it's for a uni project. I really appreciate this as a cobver-up but I just don't think it'll wash. Anyone male in my family would cringe like mad at being asked to describe another guy in three words, and my mates, well... you expect a group of lads to give serious answers to that (their sense of humour is appreciated, it just wouldn't make this task possible)? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to disappoint the therapist- I already struggle to know what the correct answer is to his questions during sessions, and I can tell he thinks I'm weird. I desperately want to get better - this has been going in since I was 10 - and I've tried counselling twice before. I was going to try medication (which all counsellors I've met have told me not to, but with no reasons given) but can't now as the health servcie is so overworked right now.

Also there is one thing I want to discuss with the counsellor really badly (sexual abuse when I was a child, sorry if TMI), but he said in our first meeting that it's an ethics violation. I can't afford a proper counsellor (this is free through uni- I'm aware how priviledged I am and I am sorry that I'm just complaining) so I'd appreciate any advice on how I could work through this.

Thank you, and sorry again that I am complaining.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't think I'm depressed or anything, but if I was given the option to never have existed I would take it. I never asked for life and I don't think I want it. The only thing keeping me going I suppose is the trauma I would inflict if people found my body in my apartment. Besides that my parents spent a lot of money on my education and without me to provide for them when I finish they may end up in poverty. I'm trying to do better but some things just seem to be taking me 10 steps back the moment I try harder. I think I'm growing number to life.

I don't know how to deal with this anymore.,"Since I could remember I've always been off emotionally, I've tried therapy, and medications it never helped. I should probably give context but, I am just lonely to the point where I feel like nobody gives a shit if I'm alive or dead, even though I know I have people that care. I get really kind of ""crazy"" if you will, when I'm having a depressive episode. When it gets really bad I isolate myself from everyone around me, and it usually helps calm me down if I'm getting to manic. This would work when I had school and saw people, I was able to sort of have a connection to the outside world, then I'd go home and not talk to anyone and just listen to music and exist. Now that we have a self-quatantine all day I'm just alone, and when I have these episodes I have no one to turn to. Even to my closest friends I feel like a burden, and I don't want them to worry, I'm aware at how cliche I am. The last few days have been really hard, and I just don't know how much of this I can take while being alone. I just feel very panicky, alone, empty and depressed, and usually my ""episodes"" don't last several days, but this one is, and I don't know how to deal with it now. My only coping mechanism doesn't work anymore since I can't go to school then isolate myself. And it's getting awfully painful just being me, and living like this. I know and hope it'll be better soon, but right now things look awfully grim and I don't know what to do about any of yhis.

I depress my partner...,"My partner and I have been together for 11 years now. We're very much alike and most times, that's great. Except for one.

We both suffer from depression. Different reasons sprouting from different childhood crap, but the end result is the same; both of us lying in bed for a few days under the covers. The problem is, I think my partner is an emotional sponge, because it almost ALWAYS works out that I get depressed first and then he will too, just two days behind. It's gotten to the point that I'm getting really intense anxiety over getting depressed myself because I don't want to do that to him. It feels like something I'm inflicting on him and then leaving him out to dry cuz I'm still screwed up. I'm there for him when he's depressed, no question. But anyone who has had depression knows you're not 100% when in the middle of it, and it seems so unfair to me that he's the strong one for me but then doesn't get the same level of help when he goes under. It's like I get someone to lean on but then he only gets someone to wallow with.

He says that's all he wants, just some company and reassurance. But it's hard to really hear that; I was raised by narcissists and it's still hard to really accept that I don't have to be on top of/am not to blame for other people's emotional state. I just want some advice on how to better deal with the anxious thoughts surrounding this so I don't feel like it's something I'm putting him through, or maybe just some general ideas of how to better be there for him when I'm depressed too.

Family crises,"I'm 31. 9 years ago I met my wife in my small hometown in East Tennessee. I fell in love with her, but she was from Midwest Florida, and had a 3 year old son already. Soon after we met she got pregnant with my son. Growing up with a father that lived in Illinois, I knew immediately that I would do anything to be there for my unborn child. So, we decided to move to her home town in Florida where all of her family is, get married and start raising her first born and our new baby. I've always had depression to some degree. We've had a rough marriage almost from the start. So, we've slowly been drifting apart this whole time. On March 28th we started the day off with sex. I felt like a million bucks.

She wanted to go to a hotel to ""get away"" I supported her decision to take some time for her self and told her she should go. Eventually she decided to not go to the hotel and instead go out with one of her girlfriends and her sister. I once again supported her decision. She left at 2pm. As I was at home with our boys playing in the pool making burgers for them and having fun I realized she'd been gone for almost 6 hours. I started calling her and she wouldn't pick up, so I Facebook messaged her friend she said she was with, and asked her to have her give me a call. Her friend was surprised to say the least that I was contacting her, mainly because she wasn't with her. She finally called me around 8:30 after her friend contacted her to see what was going on. Caught in her lie, she immediately confessed that she had driven an hour and a half to go out on a 37 year old rich guys boat for a while. After their boat ride, they went to go get Publix subs in his 2020 Corvette. My wife works at a successful car lot, and this was one of her customers. she actually sold him the boat and the Corvette. He knows that she's married with kids. She swears they didn't do anything sexual. I'm kinda losing my shit right now..... I've always been suicidal. My mom caught me in 5th grade trying to kill myself. I love my boys more than anything in the world, and I love her. She's got an amazing family that supports her no matter what (as the should). So she talked to her family about what happened and they all have her confidence. I don't have any family here, nowhere to go when things get rough. She's just acting like nothing happened. I'm extremely upset about it, she said they didn't do anything, but I can't stop thinking about her fucking some other guy in his boat. Before the Corona virus we went to 1 therapy session, and the woman diagnosed me with severe anxiety disorder, and that we need to get to the bottom of my problems so I could be a better man for her. We have a phone conference scheduled for Wednesday. I couldn't sleep last night, my heart has been beating out of my chest, I can't relax, and my breaths are short but frequent. So far it's not let up, I'm sitting in an empty church parking lot right now. I wanted to post this to get it off my chest and maybe give me relief? The feelings of suicide are very strong right now, but I could never do that to my boys. I have no where to turn, and I don't know what to do about it. All I can do is think of how much of a piece of shit I am to push her to this point which isn't helping my already venomous thoughts about myself..... I don't want a divorce, but I'm so upset, I can't even look at her.....thanks for reading","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
I changed physically,"I (27f) recently got a dramatic haircut and gained weight (about 5kg) and was too depressed to do anything about it. It lead to acne, hair all over my body and face

It's getting worse with my need to be validated and I feel that the more needy I become the less people reassure me or want to interact with me.

My social media likes have gone from 100 to 0 real fast and I have no self esteem any more. I wonder if I whined about my image too much and if my friends just hate me now or got sick of me.

I am since trying to tackle the weight and interact positively on Facebook and Instagram but no one wants to know any more. Has depression and anxiety ruined my life? My image to myself and others?

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?,"
I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for nearly five years now but recently been dealing some stuff I haven't experienced before. I've been having  thoughts that I feel like i can't control - not all the time but a lot. When it happens i feel out of control and like I can't stop thinking. Normally those thoughts are desperate or self loathing and sometimes its suicidal (not active). I feel like someone is injecting thoughts into me and that I'm just kinda there as those thoughts are happening unable to stop it. 

I've also been having weird dazes where I feel like I'm just doing everything on autopilot. I don't really know how to describe it honestly except sometimes I feel like I'm thinking nothing at all, or sometimes it goes hand in hand with those racing thoughts. A couple of times when this happened at college I would be walking around campus but didn't feel like I was really there. 

I don't know what's going on but I feel very out of control and i'm worried.

I don’t know what’s going on,"I was always the guy that never thought he would get depression you know. Honestly me even saying that I have depression makes me feel like less of a man, it makes me feel like one of those emo and edgy kids from school pretending to be depressed and in their feelings. 
Everytime I felt sadness or lonely I just take a break and go to sleep or just get back on the grind and try to push through it. 
But I don’t know, lately it’s gotten so much worse. 

Two weeks ago for a whole week straight I had insomnia, and I’ve been feeling lost, unmotivated, frustrated, anxious with everything. My life is falling apart because I’ve been being unmotivated to do anything. 
And back then If I ever felt unmotivated I always thought that it was just a lack of discipline to do the things I dream and strive for. 
But lately it’s been different. I’ve been in my feelings every night, and I sleep for more than 10
Hours daily. I’m always tired, I feel lethargic, unmotivated, and I need help. 

I looked up what the things I’ve been feeling could mean, and the Internet keeps suggesting I have depression. 
But I don’t feel overwhelmingly sad, I just feel overwhelmed, stressed out all the time, my body doesn’t just want to do anything. My
Mind just wants to take a day off. I just wanna give up on life. No I don’t want to die, but I can’t bring myself to try anything anymore. I want to make D1 Soccer in college, but I just don’t feel like it anymore to practice and train and so I deteriorate in skill and fitness. 
I guess this is Karma because someone told me a while back they were feeling the things I’m feeling now and I just told them to step up and be a man, and kind of just disregarded the
Possibility of them actually being depressed. Even then, I used to have a friend who was depressed and I told her to just stop being depressed and own up to her actions and feelings, I told her it was just a lack of strength and that she just lacked discipline. 

But I guess now I understand. And I hate it. I’m not a weak person, I was so dedicated to soccer, and I was full of motivation like a
Month ago, I don’t know what happened. I decided to just take a step back and figure it all out, where these feelings are coming from. I realized that I have something deep inside of me, but I don’t know what it is. It’s so much i have to keep digging. 
For 2 weeks I’ve stayed up thinking and praying and just trying to figure it out. 

I didn’t know I was hurt, I didn’t know I was lonely, I used to Just say fuck it, fuck feelings, pro athletes make it big because they don’t let their feelings get in the way. And
For a while it worked. Until it didn’t. 

I keep unpacking and unpacking. 

I don’t know what to do. I tell myself I’m going to turn my life around but every morning I fail. I’m on my way to being bed ridden, it’s just a matter of time. I’m losing motivation day by day. 

I don’t know what to do. If I ask my parents to take me to a therapist they’ll just shrug it off because they won’t believe I have depression. I don’t even want to have depression, and I want to believe that I don’t even have it. 

But I don’t know. I guess I just need to let it all out you know?

I feel so alone. I feel lonelier in school and in class with 25 other people in the room than I do in an empty house. I feel lonelier in a crowd than I do just being alone in my bed room. 
I don’t have anyone in my life who will really care about me you know, like take the time to understand me. I know my parents care, but they won’t understand me, and trust me I’ve tried. There’s such a divided of culture and philosophy between us. They’ve come from a poor background and worked their way up to have a stable and happy life with me and my brother. They never felt depressed, they never looked back, they just worked and kept going. And that’s why I’m trying so hard to just be so strong and try to not let depression just get in my way,because they had it worst than I did and they achieved so much. But it’s so hard. Nobody hits my phone up, asking me what’s up, or how I’ve been. And if they do, if I say horrible or try to talk to them, they’re gonna be like “oh sorry man, hope you feel better”. No one is there to understand me, or take the time to really care. Friends? What friends? All of them are horny simps. They would talk behind my back if it meant they could keep the conversation going longer with girls, and trust me it’s happened on more than one occasion. They’re all dicks. I’m supposed to pretend to be fine and happy and chill, or else I’ll be judged for being in my feelings. They’ll say I’m on my man period or something. I don’t have friends, and I’ve been trying to distance myself from the people I hang out with. 

How do they do it? They all loook so happy. Messing around with girls, being happy with their girlfriends. They’re all so happy to have each other man. They’re so tight. And I’m not part of their deep circle. I don’t want to be. I don’t want to be like them. And I have no deep circle of my own. 
I have no one who has my back. A lot of my “friends” just use me to cover for them if they didn’t finish their homework. 


I got the captaincy on my soccer team. I know many of those “friends” who are my teammates have been plotting and feinding behind my back. 

I’ve tried talking to girls, but I lose interest real quick because I know i won’t get anything deep with them, I won’t have a real connection with them, because I feel like I can’t trust them.

I feel like I can’t trust anyone. They can’t understand me. They can’t understand what I’m going through. 

Before this covid 19 shit, everyday I go to school I just see everyone in their groups talking and smiling. And I don’t know, for 3 months I really haven’t felt like I’ve been a part of a group, man. I don’t feel like anyone out there is gonna give me the support. 

The last relationship I was in, I thought I fell in love with her, and she said she loved me too. But I always fought with her. I realize now that it was just me trying to push her away, because I was scared of her leaving, so I tried to push her away subconsciously because I was scared that she would break my heart and so i just wanted to have an excuse to break it off first before she could have a chance to hurt me. 
And I kept telling her to leave, but she said that she wasn’t gonna go anywhere because I was worth it. And slowly I started feeling at ease. But then we broke up. We had a huge fight about her not putting me first, her best friend getting in the way. I said I would choose my dreams over her, but I also said I didn’t want to lose her. And then she said I lost her already. And we broke it off. 
She said that she would stay. She said she would stay and figure it out. But she didn’t. I guess she just couldn’t take it anymore. 

Everyone tells me they’re going to be there for me, but when I need them the most they aren’t there. 

It’s hard for me to trust. 

Sophomore year, second semester, I lost faith in everyone. My best friends left me. I felt so alone.I hovered around different friend groups but I still felt alone. I was bedridden for a time. I think I buried it deep down , because I don’t remember much about that year except how I had the worst season in soccer of my life and that I wanted to die. I didn’t see a reason for living, and I hated everyone.

And then that summer I got my shit together, started training for soccer,and I thought I healed. But I guess I didn’t because junior year here we are. 

I feel abandoned. I feel alone. I feel lost. 
These things never bothered me before, but why now???? 
WHY IS IT PULLING ME DOWN NOW? I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS THESE PROBLEMS ALL JUNIOR YEAR?! 

You know my ex, got over me so quick. She already found a prom date, and she and her best friend replaced me with another guy. Double replaced. This guy they replaced me with is annoying as hell though, but he’s so much smarter and more athletic than me. I guess they did better than I did. 

I’m just here alone, no one to have my back. I guarantee you, no one would give two fucks about me. No one thinks about me. No one is there to check up on me. I have no one.

Feeling bad for doing better?,"Let me start with a little backstory.  
My mental health has been slowly deteriorating since October. It got to the point in January/February where I couldn't function normally, I wasn't going out, I couldn't eat, slept the days away and I even failed one of my classes because I couldn't focus on studing. At the end of February I went to my university's psychologist and the lady suggested that I should go to the psychiatrist and go on antidepressants. I wasn't really surprised so I've made the appointment and was really hopeful to get my life together.  
But then the coronavirus happend, my appointment got cancelled, uni went online and I had to go back home. I was terribly disappointed, to say the least. And because I'm home and I'm around people all the time I don't allow myself to be extremely depressed. I force myself to go out of bed, to eat, to somehow function because I'm scared to show how I'm trully feeling. I've completely disconnected from my feelings to the point where I don't feel anything.   
And in the back of my head there is that voice, that is saying that I'm faking being depressed, that if I wanted to I could've been better at the begging of the year, that it's all in my head and I had no reason to feel this way.   
So my question is how to understand that just because I'm ""doing better"" at the moment I'm not magically healthy? Because I'm afraid that I'll convince myself that I don't need help and I won't ever go to psychiatrist.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

anyone else struggle with finding value in themselves because nobody else does? you feel inadequate because nobody else cares about you...,"I don’t know why it’s so hard to be content with myself. Be on my own. Rely only one myself. But I need people. 

Do you feel like you stopped caring about yourself and stopped actively ‘living life’ because it seems like nobody in the world gives a damn whether you’re dead or alive?


Like, nobody ever contacts you or reaches out to ask how you’re doing. you spend so much time pouring into relationships, doing your best to make sure people like you and then in the end...they just forget you. You only hear from them when YOU initiate contact.

I guess i’m just wondering if anyone else has a fear of being forgotten. I spent so much time nurturing and cultivating these relationships but ultimately...you can’t keep it alive on your own. It has to be a mutual effort. And that’s what kills me....being the only one that cares. It’s always been this way.

Being the only one that misses people. People who probably have never even had a passing thought about you. I guess i’m just having a hard time accepting the fact that I don’t mean anything to anyone. 

How do you guys cope with the silence? Waking up every day with this intense emptiness that almost paralyzes you. Knowing today is another day I won’t hear from anybody.

I can’t go more than 5 minutes without crying,"These last few weeks have been the hardest in my life. After covid cleared out college campuses and my partner and I were forced to go back home my boyfriends family told him since he was back living under their roof he would have to follow every one of their demands. In the town where we go to college we were seeing each other multiple times a week. And the week before we were booted we spent every hour together. As soon as we got home his family told him he could no longer see me. I understand we are in a pandemic but we had been swapping spit even that same day they told him to quarantine. If he had anything I definitely had it and vice versa. I agreed to two weeks not seeing each other, not knowing how hard it would be. Even after that ended they didn’t want us to see each other because during that time my state issued a stay at home order. I have not been able to see friends (obviously) and my family is abusive and toxic there isn’t a single day in the house that there aren’t screaming matches.

No longer actively depressed but now I need help beating the apathy.,"I think my life has been changed forever by the major depressive episode I had last year. I don’t think I’ll ever feel quite like that again (I hope), but it’s left me a parting gift. I just don’t care about most things anymore. 

This is positive in some ways — it makes me less of a perfectionist for example; good enough is fine and I don’t get choked up on the little things as much. However, it is also very very negative in other ways. I will go for several weeks without doing my laundry, wait until the last second to do assignments, won’t clean, etc. I have NO sense of urgency or shame, particularly urgency, but still have minor guilt after the fact if someone comments on my slobbishness. Like, if someone was coming over and I had an hour to clean I wouldn’t get everything done. I’d probably pick up a few things and say I’m sorry for the mess and feel guilty afterwards that I’m a slob. But it wouldn’t make me change, however and that annoys me. 

I know that I do care that these things are happening, but there’s a total disconnect from actually caring enough to do them respectably. For example, I would like to clean my room because I enjoy the look and space of a clean room. I know it makes me feel accomplished when I do. But a bigger part of my brain doesn’t mind living in squalor because it is so apathetic to everything. I don’t like this about myself. I want to be timely and disciplined but I have a hard time caring and almost 0 motivation (though it’s slowly creeping back in occasionally). 

I feel this may be a discipline issue but I would also like some sense of motivation or ambition. I get like this with my career goals too.

Thank you for reading.,"Hey,

I don't know if anyone is going to read this or not, but if you do, thank you.

I haven't been on a date in two years, been intimate with someone in 3, I know that doesn't matter and it doesn't matter to me that much. But it feels nice to be attracted to in some way. Every single girl in the past two years has ghosted me. Every. Single. One. I tried paying for tinder, paying for match, paying for bumble, and clover. Tinder is kind of a joke but I'm just saying I tried them all. I went out and tried to meet people in bars, games, events. I've had a woman look me up and down and say ""ew"" and walk away after I tried to talk to her. I don't know, the biggest thing I want in life is a loving wife and beautiful children. And I may only be 22 but I want that long relationship where there is nothing but love, started at a young age. I don't want to be 50 finding my soulmate. But nowadays people see one thing they don't like about you and they just assume the relationship will never work.

I've lost several friends this year because of how things have changed. My friends also ended up trying to make plans without me and hide the fact they were hanging out, most of the time it was because they wanted to smoke, and I dont. And my work has me travel, often, and for at least a few weeks at a time several states away and I can't go out and spend time with friends or family, because I don't know anyone and there aren't any co-workers nearby because they usually send me to areas where they have no one. And it just amplifies the depression and started to develop insomnia because of my depression and having a hard time trying to fall asleep in a hotel room.

I also play softball, I'm halfway decent but I'm not good and it gets to a point where there are really good players on the team and I still end up sitting the bench, I even paid to be on the team and they didn't, I ended up paying to play this year but kind of have my heart set on quitting, it's gotten to be toxic to me because I expect more out of myself than what happens, and just like the world everyone focuses on what you did wrong, not the many good things you have done.

This quarantine has not helped me mentally and the constant ghosting, friends making plans without me, and softball. Thank you for listening.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Idk how to get out of this funk I’m in,"So I’ve been out of school for the past month now because of the plague and honestly idk how to recover from... whatever I’m going through.

Like I understand that self isolation is important, and I get that it’s required and I want to do whatever I can to help, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s making me go insane. I keep telling myself I shouldn’t be angry or let it get to me because I’m living with my mom who’s in a nice house and I have books, computer, a switch, and all the Netflix and Disney+ I could want, but I cannot find motivation to do anything.

I really don’t do well with online schooling in general, and on top of that I’m an art major taking 16 credits of classes that all have finals of performances so online school just got a whole hell of a lot more inconvenient. And I’m doing my best but I didn’t “go” to class today or Monday because I just couldn’t get out of bed. 

I feel like if I could find something to work on I’d feel better but I just feel like nothing is coming to mind. I joked with a friend about starting a YouTube channel because at the very least it’ll give me a project to focus on and improve my video editing skills (double major film production and theatrical design so it also feels relevant to my future) but I don’t have any ideas or content which is probably a large problem in that plan.

Idk, does anyone have advice for how to actually find motivation to do stuff? I’m struggling to do anything that isn’t work (I work at my university but because I moved off campus I now have ~1.5 hour commute each way) and I hate feeling like I’m wasting my life away doing nothing when I could be doing something.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
"I really just hate myself and I'm trying to change, but it might be too late?","I'm 31, live with my mom and her boyfriend, and have 0 social life. 

I suck at my job that I don't even like. I have a shitty attitude about everything and I constantly feel down and like I'm missing something. I don't have any of what I consider REAL problems on the outside so people often wonder ""What is even her problem?!"". It was more like I was lazy and finding myself and now at 31, my family is very concerned about me. They're all just as messed up, so it is even more humiliating for me that they are even worried.

My major problem is I have no spine, I try way too hard to be liked, and I have lost touch with reality and what it means to engage with other people. After much reflection, I have no idea how to change. I'm truly one of those ""toxic"" people in every sense of the word and I don't know how to change or be aware of myself. I have no friends, no kids, no one but my mom.

It's so embarrassing, but I feel like a teenager still. Like I have no idea how to care for myself or be my own age. I still feel like I'm just starting out, but I'm not. I just cant get myself together.

My mom wants me out, people ask me all the time why I don't do certain things or go out or meet people. My anxiety si through the roof and my depression is out of the world and it all boils down to one simple fact - I am in my own way. Everything is entirely my fault and I don't know how to change.

I Don't Want to Talk About It,"I am depressed. I live a joyless life. I don't want to kill myself but I don't really see the point in living.

I keep seeing ads or public service announcements with celebrities that say: ""Do you want to talk about it?"" ""Find someone to talk to."" ""I'm here for you to talk to."" My problem is that I don't want to talk about it. I am ashamed. I feel weak and incapable of solving my own problems. I feel like my life is objectively great with no real reason to feel this way. I don't want to whine, I don't want to dwell.

But I do recognize that talking about it has to happen if anything is going to get better.

The people close to me clearly see there's a problem and inquire. My default response is: ""I don't want to talk about it."" Or I ignore the question. Or I change the subject.

"Scared, lazy, anxious, perfectionism and depression, messed up life I got","I hate myself every time there's a opportunity to learn something new, here I am hesitating when to start, staring blankly on the screen, then the worst part procrastinating on memes, funny videos, netflix or even house chores.

Challenges I hate that, I envy my friends, always ready to take on new challenges, being the best version of their self and then they reap the rewards of taking the risk, the opposite happens when I face new challenges, panic attack, complaining, whining and thinking negative constantly. My friends are earning near six digits yet me is stuggling to get by on my meager income, most of the time thinking I might get fired on every messed up I did on the office. 

I always wanna learn to code so I may better my chance of earning more or atleast a self fulling hobby, when there's an opportunity or time to learn I always hesitate on starting maybe because I'm scared like a kid who is afraid of math. Coding is painful especially the debugging part but it is very fulfilling once everything run. When I was a kid I love to draw but my parents enrolled me on a engineering course focusing on IT, so there goes my hobby slowly getting forgotten. I envy my friends in college who are quite into technical stuff, I do love tinkering but when it comes to tinkering something about school there goes me, avoiding it or procrastinating on studying. I know a bit of coding stuff but I'm not that good on analyzing instruction, algorithm, pseudocode etc. I struggled at school but manage to graduate with not so good grades (average, just passing). So theres that my opportunity getting hired is not so good but still manage to get a job (Im thankful they still haven't fired me at the office, even tho I'm the dumbest, cringiest, lowest confidence employee, slow on getting instruction and full of typos on my email and bad at presentation/report)

I wanna conquer my fear but anxiety is messing up with me. Then depression sets in reminding me I'm a failure at everything I do, anxiety letting me think I'm hated by everyone and everything would go south.

But I would be able to live with that, maybe even fix it, but now I am locked with two horny people in one house and I want to blow my brains out. (metaphorically speaking so far). Headphones help a bit, but its not only about noises as you guys might guess. I cant stand their happiness, it just reminds me of what I am missing out on. I can't be happy for them, and it only makes me think worse about myself. They are looking for a new place but it might take months. Same for me if I want to move out. 

I am scared of loneliness. I need some sex but it dose not work for me with prostitutes. I tried Tinder and other stuff, no real results and I am loosing hope with every day passing. I mean I am now talking to a bunch of strangers on the internet to flush some of my frustration away and get advice.

I started therapy but it is too early to say if it helps. I don't want to be swallowed by this demon but it is chewing on me for some time now. Maybe you guys can help me out...

How do you get past feelings of guilt?,"Hi everyone,

I've been recently wondering what to do to get past feelings of guilt over past mistakes and wrongdoings. I know that I hurt some close friends quite badly when I was severely depressed. (I'm not using it as an excuse for my behaviour, as I still said the terrible things and was unkind to them.) Now, I've looked at those mistakes, spoken to people and have been working to make myself a better person and hopefully a better friend to other people in the future. 

Given all of this, how can I get over the feelings of guilt over what was said? I know it's not healthy to hold onto such feelings but at the same time, I'm not sure how to stop thinking about those actions and feeling bad.

I've read somewhere that as we grow, learn and improve from our mistakes and to forgive ourselves, but I am not sure what techniques to try in order to do this.

Thank you for reading :)","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really need help,"I need help

I have a step dad and a rather emotionless mother. They've always been very ""bossy"" in a way. By that I mean they do whatever they want to and they don't care about my opinion at all. And when I try to talk to them calmly they just say stuff like - ""This is how we are and you can't do anything about it"". They also call me hopeless a lot of times and say personal things to me and this has always happened but I expected it to stop when I turned 18 a month back. They're currently angry at me and they're blocking the wifi and my sim card for no apparent reason and I just feel so helpless. I can't talk to them or make them understand how I feel. When I told my mother that I have nobody in this house to talk to she said ""aw you've had such a sad childhood you're so innocent but im sorry thats just how it is"".  They take away my phone whenever they're upset and I'm stuck in the house because of quarantine and I just dont know what to do. And to make it a little clear, my real dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mother STILL says stuff like that to me. 

I've also lost touch with almost every friend I have. I do talk to them but its empty talk. I only really have one person in my life that I can talk to, and that is my girlfriend. Just the thought of her not being there makes me feel so alone

Can SSRIs worsen creativity/interest in arts/music?,"Hi, not sure where to post this. I’ve been making music since I was 7, and I come from a traumatic background. In bad times, I’ve often turned to music to help me deal with the negative feelings and it has been constructive most of the time. My mental health got worse through high school and college as a result of constantly repressing my trauma and trying to push through with sheer willpower and stubbornness. My life is a wreck as a result; I’ll spare the details, but I now have no college degree and haven’t held a reliable job in almost three years now. I kept up music through those hard times, and the last song I wrote/released was in August of 2019. Around the same time, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with OCD and I switched from Prozac to Zoloft (both SSRIs) which I’m currently on. The OCD has improved somewhat, but I can’t bring myself to play my instruments since that month and I don’t know why. Even when I listen to music on Spotify, which I used to do for hours per day by choice/enjoyment, it feels like I just hear noise now; the patterns that I know I could recognize by ear before feel arbitrary and I lose interest before it can even form. I’m doing introspection with my therapist and trying to get to the root of this problem, and I’m sure there are environmental factors/life events that have contributed to this as well. Is this a common side effect for musicians/artists on antidepressants? It’s hard to find anything written on the matter online.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

How to talk to doc?,"Hi all. 24 M here and around thanksgiving I finally did something about my depression and mentioned it to my primary care doc.

I know mood swings can be a side effect of a lot of antidepressants, but I’m finding myself more prone to flying off the handle into fits of anger super quickly.

I'm obsessing over a man that doesnt think twice about me.,"So here's the deal. I've been involved off and on with this guy for over a year, with a strong falling out ending our ""friends with benefits"" the first time. But once we matured and got over it, we started seeing each other again. I've always had feelings for him, but have kept them at bay. He's very aware of these feelings because I've told him. However, he doesnt want ANYTHING more than booty calls and the occasional sleep over. He's honestly kind of an asshole, but I am so fucking infatuated with him that it scares me. I find myself constantly checking to see if he's read my messages or is online or has posted something. I can't stop thinking about him. 
I try so hard to keep myself distracted with work or hobbies, but my mind immediately goes right back to him when it's all done...

My teen brother depressed during quarantine,"Hi all,

This is my first time posting so I apologize if I miss a flair or something.

First of all, I'm a grad student living at home with family. I have a 16 year old brother that I live with, with my mom and other sibling (father comes by often to visit). My bro has always been the type of teen to spend hours alone in his room, usually in bed, in the dark (lights almost always off). He is usually on his phone and listening to music. Pretty typical teen stuff though the fact he sometimes spends hours in his room in the dark, not particularly doing anything, has always worried me. 

Since quarantining, so for about a month, he has become increasingly lethargic and unmotivated. He doesn't want to go outside for walks or drives. He is doing some of his school work, but missing meetings and other assignments. His sleep schedule is all over the place, I honestly don't know how much he sleeps and how much he just spends laying in bed.

My parents are not the best at handling the situation. It usually results in yelling, sometimes violence, and my brother usually reverts more into his seclusion and silence. I'm basically just looking for any advice. How can I help him?

Throw away account just cause I don’t feel real comfortable posting this on my main account. Also excuse the formatting If it’s not correct, and the length.

Shes known I’ve had the feelings for her for the last 7 years and she always tells me she doesn’t feel the same way. We’ve had so many arguments over some real stupid shit like her blocking me on social media when she goes out so I don’t see any photos of her with guys because she knows I get real upset about it. 

Every time we have the conversation of my feelings I always ask her to be honest with me and tell me if she’s talking to someone, because it’ll hurt me less coming from her rather than me finding out the hard way, and she always tells me no. The last time we had this conversation was 2 weeks ago. 

Fast forward to tonight, I had a mutual friend come over who I haven’t seen in around 2 years who asked me if I still have feelings for her. Me not wanting to show my emotions said I don’t, so she then followed by saying “oh my god can you believe she’s talking to *name**. I was like wtf are you talking about? She then began to tell me how she has been talking to our mutual  friends friend for the last 2-3 months. She then began to show me all these photos and messages that the mutual has shown her, so I got to see everything with my own eyes. I always had a feeling she was hiding something from me but I always got the answer no from her so I always ignored. 

She’s my best friend, she’s literally the reason I’m still alive. I’ve been through hell and back with her, and I value her friendship so much that I can get through all the suffering and pain I have when she’s around just so I can spend some time with her, but all she does when she comes over is sit on her phone for hours and just smiles at it. 

I’m an absolulte mess right now. I have a heart condition and the last couple hours I felt like I was having a heart attack (from my anxiety attack) but that’s only because I’ve had a couple hours to take in the news. 

What do I do? We haven’t spoken in 2 weeks. I actually tried to call her today to see how she was cause we haven’t spoken and I did not receive a reply. 



Do I bring it up to her? I know she’s just gonna lie to me and tell me she isn’t talking to anyone. Do I just delete her out of my life? I’m so lost and confused. It’s a 14 year friendship (and my only true friend) and I don’t want to lose it, but I don’t think I can ever look at her the same or talk to her for at least a long time because she knew that me finding out would hurt me. I even told her I’d rather hear it from her rather than anyone else because it’ll hurt less, and she always says to me if I ever found out she was talking g to someone she knows I would kill myself. 

I’d love to get some advice on what to do, because I don’t have anybody to talk to about my problems other than her, but unfortunately this is about her. 

I understand that none of this is her fault because you can’t control your feelings. But I’m upset at the fact that she hid this from me, and apparently saw him and made out with him before she came over to my house for my birthday a few weeks ago.




TLDR: in love with my best friend. She doesn’t have feelings for me. She hid the fact she’s been speaking to a guy which really hurt me cause I told her if she ever was to tell me because it would hurt less. She knows about my feelings and I know she doesn’t have feelings for me. But I think she should of told me because now it has broken all my trust from her cause she lied.

I'm tired of my lack of motivation,"Hi, first post here, so Idk if the flair is right and if I will be able to put in words my feelings. Anyways, I'll give it a try, so sorry for the long post.

Since the beggining of the quarantine I came to live with my boyfriend bc I know if I didn't see him often I would lose my mind and terrible things might happen. My college is trying to transform our courses in online courses, and is mainly succeeding. In the beggining I sort out everything I should do, to not leave everything to the last minute, so in the first weeks I worked like crazy and managed to anticipate the majority of my tasks. This leads me to last week.

Last week I confirmed through my professors and schedules that I was ahead of almost everything. I read most of the texts, wrote most essays, made almost everything that I could do. I had almost no day to just relax or do only minor chores. So when I took my bullet journal to schedule last week and this current one, I saw that if I did one task per day I would be free to read my book and be concerned with other things, since college stuff would be done. So I distributed one task for each day untill the end of this week. But I CAN'T DO THEM!

It is driving me crazy because it is only one simple task I must do that day, but I can't find ANY motivation to do them and now they're accumulating! I'm getting mad at myself because its just one stupid task! And I can't do it!

And this lack of motivation is affecting other things. I can't wake up early to do my exercises anymore, I can't be happy doing lunch (I loved to cook, but now its just an obligation), even my games and my books don't make me happy anymore! I'm in a constant state of apathy and I hate this! And now I'm concerned that because of this my boyfriend will think that I'm just not happy around him bc of him, and thats not the problem at all.

Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for ""hearing"" me. I would really appreciate some support words. I think I need an outsider to tell me there's a way to be okay again.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've thought of killing myself many times before, but I've never gone through with it because of the impact it would have on my family and the people I care for.

My best friend is a girl who I've fallen in love with so hard that I would literally give anything just to see her happy. But she doesn't feel the same way towards me and I don't want to leave her as I'm the person she turns to whenever she has a depressive episode.

If I ended my life she would be left with nobody and I'm scared for what would happen to her, but I know she won't ever need me the way I need her and that thought itself is one of the reasons why I feel so down. I don't think I'm ever going to love anyone to the extent I love her so what's the point of living if I'm never going to be able to feel emotion to that same level.

Has anyone tried online or phone therapy? Any recommendations?,"Over the winter, I had been looking for a therapist in my city. After reaching out to several therapist with no replies, I just figured I didn't sound like a good candidate to them and I kind of got lazy and put it off. I have state insurance so maybe that's unappealing to therapists? 

Anyway I just tried to deal with my issues on my own and it was working ok for a few months. Then a month later the whole world kinda ended with this pandemic and people getting sick. Now the dread has returned times a million and I feel like I just can't cope on my own anymore. I know there so many others who have it WAY worse than myself. I have only been financially affected. I'm young and still healthy but I just can't pull myself out of this black hole. All my old problems have been dumped on with new problems from this pandemic and now its overflowing. I hyperventilate every time I think about my future and how I will pay my bills (event/gig worker here) on top of all the issues that I had before this.

Still hurting from betrayal,"I posted awhile back but I am still having trouble and I would appreciate the support. My \[26M\] ex gf \[26F\] cheated on me and left me for some guy she had only known for 3 weeks. I loved her so much. We had been together for almost 7 years. We had plans to get married and buy a home together. To travel together have kids and start a family together  She abandoned me and the dog we raised together for some low life with no career or education that pursued her knowing we were in a committed relationship.

It hurts. There are so many memories of the good times we spent together. I was so close with her family. She had always said she couldn't imagine her life without me. Now she's off with this horrible person acting like they're soulmates. I know I deserve better than someone who would cheat on me and lie about it. I am just still having trouble believing she actually did this to me and that she's gone and never coming back.

I was such a good boyfriend. I made her breakfast in bed and surprised her with dinner when she had a late shift. I would plan special surprises for the holidays and birthdays. Yet she still cheated on me and left me. I go from sad to angry to depressed to sad again. I don't really know what to do.

Depressed Partner (quarantine),"Hi!

F(29) M(29)

My partner of 2 years asked me for space on Thursday after his therapist appointment.He said he didn't want to make any rushed decision (breakup) until he had a more clear view of things.We had just moved in together in January and now he isn't sure if he was ready. He has been struggling with being stuck at home, no sports on tv, and me nagging him to get out of the house with me for walks or just even eating in our patio. I had no background or knew how to deal with depression so I cried and made him feel responsible for what he was feeling. He said he was confused and didn't know if the quarantine or our relationship where the real cause of his depression. I left but didn't even hug him. I made some research and felt so gulty of not being compassionate to him and went back on Friday to beg him to trust me. He said he still needed time but that everything I had said helped him. I stayed away but reading everything I could, joined TalkSpace (which has helped me a lot) and felt very connected with people going through the same thing. I slowly realized his illness made him so unworthy of love that he felt that me being out of his life would help him. I kept on sending text of encourganmet once a day and have food, essentials deliveries to the house (the quarantine does not help). Today I came over in the morning and let our dog out and fed her. He was still in bed, I came in the room hugged him and reassured I would always be here. He had a drained/sad look on his face but hugged me back. I said I LOVE YOU and he could bearly get the words out. I then left..... I just need some help knowing things will pass. Ive done evrything I can and all left its to wait. Its just seems impossible when all I really want to do is hug him every morning.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
Im scared i will never have friends again,"I have had major depression and anxiety my entire life, but i stopped seeing a counselor years ago. In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused.

Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i don’t want friends. But the truth is i’m scared of never having friends again.

I realized that truly the only close friends i have in my life are my boyfriend that i live with, my mom, and my boss. Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i don’t have any other friends my age.

I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others. But now i feel 10 times more lonely without social media.

How do i get out of this? I am too scared to reach out to old friends. Is it normal to have no friends? Have you gone through something similar? 

I would love to make online friends but i don’t know how. I feel so alone, especially now that corona virus has taken away my job and i have no reason to go outside. I quit college recently too so it’s really hard for me to meet new people. :(","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
Afternoon Anxiety and Depression,"For the past couple of months I have had really bad anxiety and depression at night. I have been dealing with both for years now, almost I think since middle school, I'm 27 now. However, since August of last year, when I had my first and only anxiety attack, I was out with my friends and my anxiety got so bad that I had force them to call me an uber so I could just go home and sleep it off. I told myself and my parents that if I didn't feel better in the morning, I was going to the hospital. I never felt that bad in my life and I have been worried about it happening again. There are a lot of stressful things going on in my life right now, somethings that I think maybe life changing, but I cant be sure until the time comes and it might be sooner then later. I can elaborate if you guys want, but its a long story. I feel fine in the morning, I feel great in the morning. I'm very positive and eager to get things done. It hits me around  3 or 4 pm. Something will trigger it that will cause me to think negative thoughts and it will affect me the rest of the night, but if I had that same thought at like 9 am, I would shrug it off and think, something like ""It not happening now, so don't worry about it"". It has ruined a lot of things for me. Going out with friends is now dreadful. I used to look forward to hanging out with people, but now I would rather stay at home. My sleep schedule is going to bed as early as possible because I cant stand the anxiety. It even stops me from doing chores, I drop everything and want to sleep. It seems like ever since I had the anxiety attack, this has been happening every night. Am I subconsciously worrying about having another panic attack? What can I do to help ease my thoughts. I would love to go out with my friends again without feeling this way. I am seeing a Psychologist and taking meds at the moment. Insurance sucks, so a therapist would cost me $70+ and I don't have the money for it and money is probably my biggest anxiety factor.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
"Is This Wrong, or is My Mind Sabotaging Me?","My depression really didn’t manifest significantly until four-ish years ago, when I was on my way out of high school. Having depression in college feels absolutely impossible. I find that I never have the motivation to complete my coursework and I lose interest quickly. I’m in a degree right now that I thought would be good but now it doesn’t feel right anymore. I just can’t tell if I’m unhappy because I’m doing the wrong thing, or if my mental illness is robbing me of the passion I need to enjoy my program. But I don’t have the time or the money to keep taking semesters off and swapping programs.

"I'm truly stuck - can't quit, can't work. Can't get out of bed. Desperate for any advice.","I'm a grad student and I'm suffering from depression. My progress has been slow in the last one year and my relationship with my PI is strained. Even before this pandemic, I was barely managing to do anything. I'm in a different country and my visa depends on my PhD. It was my dream to do it. Even against my family's wishes, I secured funding and it was wonderful. 

I don't know what to do. I'm really slipping. I can't seem to do anything with regard to work. But I can't seem to do anything else either. All the time I don't work, I spend feeling guilty about not working. I feel like a rat, which gets a shock if it goes right and gets a shock if it goes left at the end of a T . So it's stuck.

I am running out of time to finish this degree. I'm making progress in therapy and even doing it several times a week. But it's not helping me change my present. I won't get an opportunity like this again and see it slipping out of my hands.

It makes me feel like an unreliable, irresponsible person. I don't want to be that person. I don't want to self-sabotage. I try my best everyday. I sit down to work. My therapist even said I was the most diligent patient he's met.

Husband prioritize more Video Games,"I have an underlying condition like asthma and heart problem that's way we I opt to work from home and also my husband took a leave from him work to be safe from this virus. But recently he had this hobby and went back to video gaming and streaming through twitch. He is so into it and focus that he always wants things to  be done quickly or fast like eating, resting, watching,cooking, movie or talking with me. 

I'm being supportive with him. I even volunteer  to make the twitch banner and logo for his twitch channel. But he said when I tried to talk to him and discuss about priorities just like now, I'm not feeling well and I having extreme tummy aches and sore throat- He said I'm always criticizing and negative on him. He said I dont support him and I always go negative. I was hoping this quarantine is also a time for us to bond and get more time together but he always wants to play and stream. I felt like its okay to play and stream once in a while but not to the point you spent almost 8hours or more streaming and neglecting important things. 

Am I wrong in this?

I thought my meds were working after I reached a therapeutic level of 125mg of Zoloft but I’m not sure anymore. These overwhelming feelings are coming back. 

I mean I’m not actively suicidal or anything. But then today my sister asked me where I wanted to live in the future, and the first thing that cam to mind is that I didn’t want even live. I’m just so tired of this perpetual cycle of shit. It’s really getting draining.

 Anyways does anyone else feel this way, dead inside a little I guess. And do you guys think my meds aren’t working? I was okay until like 4 PM today. I would appreciate your opinion.

How to get through depression as a young adult ?,"Hello... I'm new to reddit, and joined this sub because I've been dealing with depression since the beginning of my teenage years and wanted to ask you guys and especially those who found a way out of depression how did you manage to get through it ?  
I'm only 18, ik i'm still young and all but I feel so empty and worthless, crying and thinking about killing myself everyday. I don't have any objective to focus on in my life that could help me cheer up and fight for. Of course I spoke with therapists but didn't keep up with the sessions because everytime I talk about my problems and my past I start crying and panicking, which makes me think even more that I'm helpless and makes me hate those sessions... Also, I find them useless for therapists say things that are really obvious, like ""if you want to have friends and go out with them, just ask people of your class to hang with you"", well thanks, but the real issue is that I can't find the motivation and courage to talk to people since I always fear to be rejected. That's for this type of answer I put an end on the sessions.  
My parents know that there's something off about me but I've always done my best in hiding how bad I feel because ik they wouldn't understand, since all they do is making jokes about my sad facial expression when I eat with them... And I have literally 0 friends IRL who I could talk to about that, only online buddies that try to cheer me up sometimes, but I can tell that they get tired of it and I can't blame them for it, ik it is hard to try helping someone but things just remain the same.  
I really want to get out of this situation...

"Hi, Im fighting my way out of my depression but it is hard. Need tips on how to motivate myself again.","Hi everyone,

I'm a uni graduate, 7 months out now but no job to show for it, a lot has gone down since this time, and i'd like to go through it if you can be patient with me. 

Before I left university everything was going well, i had just come back from an internship i had in China, I had a loving girlfriend, I graduated very well from a top universuty. And i was prepared to move forward with my life. But i think it has all gone wrong. 

(First, I had a depressive spiral in my teens that i recovered from before, i had an L4 spinal fusion and spent 6 months recovering in bed (Though snuck out to debate in parliament, take that doctors!!). Left alone with my thoughts, and my friends moving away to university. I sunk into a depression that nearly culminated in me killing myself. Though i fought my way out and tried to better myself. )

My girlfriend left me for another bloke, i got really ill and lost a lot of muscle i grew after my surgery and became skinny fat. And my Best friendship broke down after he threatened and tried to cut me with a knife (A whole Mentally ill saga that would take pages and pages to explain.). And moved back to a struggling home with physically/mentally ill parents that don't know how to support me emotionally (Not their fault!! they do try their best by me).

All of which contributed to me sinking into a depression in October, i fought my way out and applied for a range of different jobs and schemes. But didn't get on any of them. This caused another spiral that lasted till February. 

I've been fighting my way out though, i was seeing a therapist but covid killed that, and was taking antidepressants but they made things worse. 

Ive substituted them with Physical exercise. I run 10km every 6 days out of a week, and am blasting my skinny fat spots. And am learning new things with online courses and reading books that help give me meaning like Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Neitzche which helps give me purpose. 

But i struggle to motivate myself to take the extra step to get myself together and move forward with my life, Looking at job websites and stuff makes anxiety just make me freeze, or do anything i can to distract myself. Though i am fighting my depressive state, i cant help but feel apathetic about the world and about myself in it. I struggle to motivate myself because i struggle to see the point to. 

I have no real motivation to improve myself (learn to drive/code/travel more) i only seem to take interesting but impractical courses that have no physical use like ""the ancient history of food. But i feel this is just a distraction to . Apathy just feels like a slow death, and i know that the decisions i make now will shape the person i become in the future. When i try to motivate myself to learn these kinds of things, it is for material reasons, which don't appeal to me. I don't have any real motivations or dreams anymore that require me to learn them

On self-reflection, a lot of these feelings of apathy come from two key problems in my life

1.) Lack of and seeming inability to maintain meaningful relationships that sustain me-it can be days between which i get a text. It is my fault, but i seem incapable of change no matter how much i try. 

2.) Lack of purpose or community, there is little in this world that sustains me spiritually, and a lot of the world seems shallow and just full of suffering. I struggle to connect with a world that seems so indifferent. 

Sorry if any of this comes across as whiny or self-pitying, that is not my intention. 

I could just use some tips and pointers from fellow people going through this on how they motivate themselves to build better lives for themselves. As I hate feeling this consistent nothingness and want to fight to lead a life that i can be proud of.

How do I talk to my mom about my anxiety?,"These past weeks I can feel myself getting more and more anxious about EVERYTHING. I’ve had anxiety most of my life and it’s been manageable due to grounding exercises, keeping my head clear, etc but these past few weeks it’s been completely unmanageable. No matter what I do these exercises and tools haven’t been working, even if they’ve worked in the past.

My anxiety is now to the point that it’s interrupting my daily life constantly. I’ve never talked about to a doctor about my anxiety (I’m self diagnosed...I know self diagnosing is bad but I’m gonna explain why) my mom thinks the only time I need to go to the doctor is if I’m dying. She’s a psych nurse before that she was a Rn. I just wanna sit down with her and talk about what’s going on but she’ll say stuff like “there’s plenty of tools you could be using but you refuse to.” Even though most of them are tools that don’t work for me. She has anxiety and depression too, and once again she has her own tools but that’s what works for her not me. Me trying to talk to her usually ends up with her yelling at me about this or that. It’s tiring and I think I need professional help.

"I’m not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it’s making me feel even worse","I’m 16F btw. For many many years I’ve been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think “oh I don’t look too bad” and sometimes I think “oh god I can’t go out I’m so ugly”. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? I’m not sure because I can’t self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 1-2 times a day and limiting my calories. And I’m not sure if that’s extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. I’m scared to go to the extreme and go underweight (I’m close to being it) because I have a deadly disease and could die if I’m not eating properly. And I’m not too educated on ED’s so I’m not sure if I’m being too dramatic. Back to my “depression”, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they don’t want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that I’m ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe I’m all those things they’ve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best I’ve ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I don’t exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasn’t good enough, or I was too ugly that she didn’t want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that I’m so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group I’m really close with is that we have “therapy” sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. I’ve yet to have my “session” yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I can’t say cause I haven’t been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... That’s probably because I haven’t told them all this, and I would’ve but I’m afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what I’m feeling isn’t serious and they think bad of me. And I’m scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine I’m floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and I’ve always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I don’t think I would because it’s a sin in my religion, but maybe one day I’m too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it. Please reply to this, I’ve made many posts on other subreddits regarding this and no one has answered, which makes me feel like no one truly cares.

I’m dying inside 💔😩,"I wish I could stop all this major pain I feel. I want to impress but I also could care less about who thinks what. I wanted to make you feel proud, but we see how that went for all of us. I try hard everyday to make myself proud of my achievements but it’s just not worth it as much as it used to be. I used to be so proud and so excited to try my hardest for the things I loved, but notice that all of a sudden it doesn't seem to matter anymore kills me. Where did all my friends, family and love life go. Down the drain it feels like. So where do I go from here, do I keep trying or do I go get help bc I just don’t feel like I can do much of this alone for much longer. Do I give up completely? To feel so damn alone is crushing me and to feel I mean less and less every day isn’t exactly healthy. You wanna know how I made it out of my moms hell hole psycho rage house. I’ll tell you, I’m forever damaged and looking for full approval on things. I only end up attracting the worst people and I cant seem to keep a solid person in my life bc she ruined my way of judgment. My aunt tries hard to fix what I can’t even fix myself. I just want to feel loved by friends and someone I hold so near and dear and care for. But to do that, I HAVE TO HAVE FRIENDS, and  NO ANXIETY ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS, AND SOMEONE NOT HURTING ME. I fear everyday that I’ll fall back into my old habits and go suicidal. I almost want to know what it’s like to do drugs and get away from this world. I feel the pain rush through my body like electricity. I practically enjoyed that one girls night that I got so wasted that I was slurring my words for once and passed out naked in my own house. I enjoy darker things and it’s getting to dark to decipher what’s ok or not anymore. I hold in so much anger and pain that If I let it all out I’d probably cry for a week straight.

How do I get to the point of WANTING to get better?,"TL;DR - Depressed for probably 10+ years. Heavy sucidal thoughts for about 5.  
Is there any chance of getting better if I don't even want to, or seeing the point of it?

Alright, gonna keep this as short as possible, since I'm tired of giving my life story and also I hate myself for whining about this and not pulling myself up.

On the surface and in reality, my life is great. I got a job, I got a girl, I got an apartment. I got a dog. I'm healthy. I believe I'm quite intelligent (although it feels like depression has made me very much more stupider and I forget things all the time). I got it all. I can act all extroverted and social if the situation demands it. I come from a broken home with divorces, drug/alcohol/verbal and physical abuse. But I still consider my childhood to have been good. I had friends, I had fun.

I just don't want to live. I see no point in me continuing doing so other than to not mess up the lives of my friends and family (or mostly my gf and my grandma, don't care too much about the others).  
I have a very detailed and thought out plan of how I would end my life, with small chances of failure.  
I know it's not the right thing to do, but it would just feel sooo good not to feel like a useless piece of shit who cares about no one. Who sees no future or no reason in moving on. Who gets hung up on all his failures and shortcomings.

Tried several different antidepressants in increasing doses over the course of 3 years. Only gave me side effects o I quit out of spite. Seen numerous doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Only felt mocked and not taken seriously so I quit out of spite.  
Been admitted to the psychiatric ward (sry, google translate), a good place to get depressed by the way, but I talked my way out of there after a week.

I've tried quitting my job. Quitting my band. Quitting my girlfriend. Exercising. Eating heathier.  
But deep down I always knew I only made all these changes and sought help just so I could tick them off and in my suicide letter write ""look, I tried all these things and they didn't work so I killed myself instead"". Oh, and did I mention that I've only told my gf and my older sister about, and even that took YEARS this since I feel so embarrased and don't want people to get involved.  


I read about people all the time saying ""just muster through, it's worth it in the end"", or ""therapy saved my life"", or ""I know it feels dark right now..."".  
But I just can't connect with or believe in that. And I know I sound like an immature spoiled brat in saying so. How does one find the motivation or the will to fight this? I feel like giving up before actually starting the fight. It won't be worth it. I really can't see myself feeling proud, happy or satisfied about myself, or being the person I want to be. I really can't put words to my thoughts and feelings, it all sounds so banal.

I know a lot of people feel like this, like ""no one understands me, it will not work for me, there is no help I can get"" . I KNOW there is help I can get, although it hasn't for me yet. I KNOW it might get better if I put the time and effort into it. I just don't want to. I want to die. But I'm not allowed to and it pisses me off.

"First post ever, need help","This is my first post ever. I’m not diagnosed because I’m scared to ask my parents to take me to see someone. Severe anxiety and depression along with bipolar disease are all common in my family. I’m the only one who hasn’t gone to therapy. I can’t remember being truly happy.

I’m just tired and want to feel nothing,"I’ve never done a reddit post or anything before but essentially I’ve been depressed for over 10+ years (20 now) and I’m just really tired. 

For a brief summary I’ve always struggled with family (dad I don’t get along with is an arse, mom who is mentally unstable herself but is in denial and is far to kind to the point that it hurts everyone (the type to constantly be ripped off but to do the exact same thing again and again), ex-step dad who made false promises and has gone off the edge of the earth, ex-step mom whose a 14yr bitchy girl stuck inside a women’s body, older sister who is very over opinionated and it’s her way or the high way and a little sister who is young enough that she’s missed most the trauma but I don’t get to see often because she lives with my dad) I don’t want to get into it because it’s a long story that has lasted all my life. I’ve always really struggled with friends. I find it really hard to make them and when I did I would often get hurt so now there’s just a wall. And I’ve just really struggled with myself. All the usual low self esteem, anxiety, paranoia, depression. I’m keeping it brief since I feel like I can write a book.

I’m a really lonely person and have been for a long time and I know it’s because I’ve just never had a proper normal relationship with anyone. My family don’t talk about emotions and all that and with all the trauma I’ve always been very closed off with them ready to bolt as soon as I can. And since I’ve always struggled with friends I’ve just never had anyone around (I have friends now but we’re just not good friends I’m unsure how to explain it). I’ve also never had a boyfriend so it’s always felt like just me. I’m very used to people abandoning me so I’m closed off. 

My depression has also just killed the things I love as it often does and I really struggled to enjoy anything or find motivation for it. I went to uni this year and dropped out after a month and still haven’t got a job. I’ve been applying but haven’t made any cuts and for the one I made the cut for I couldn’t do cause my anxiety was so bad. I feel awful not being able to get a job and getting my shit together but nothing makes me feel motivated or happy. 

I really just want to be able to feel nothing, more out of convenience for my own and everyone else’s sake. I do really want to kill myself but I would never do it cause I know that it can fuck up those around you and I know what a persons death can do to people. I feel more like I’m just waiting for everyone to leave just so I can die without fucking anyone up. I know I’m quite smart ( the only good thing I would say about myself) and I kno there are people with lot bigger problems who still keep going but that thought only makes be feel more guilty but I also know everyone’s pain is still significant, I just go in a constant circle. 

My only safe space has been my bedroom cause it’s been the only place I could cry and breathe without being in edge around people. 

I’ve done self harm, I’ve done therapy, I’ve tried getting better by myself but I feel like I’m stuck in the same place constantly. I’m going on meds tomorrow but rather than making me feel better I’m hoping they’ll just make me feel nothing.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Now I'm almost there again, and they're stronger now, I have people who can help me but It doesnt work anymore, I've done exactly what I did last time and Nothing has even remotely helped.
Is there anything I can do to stop these thoughts while I still can?

I feel constantly lonely and as though I’m hated by everyone,"I’ve been feeling this way since I started year 7 and it has been constantly eating at me. I always have a persistent feeling that my friends aren’t actually there because they like me but rather because they feel bad for me or pity me. I haven’t ever gotten properly close to girls in fear they will hurt me which is a fear that derived from my past experiences with my step-mum and my real mum. And even if people assure me they care and are there for me, I always feel like they secretly hate me and they’re planning to hurt me or they’re talking about me behind my back. I usually just sit on my bed and cry about these problems and have been having many thoughts that the world would be better without me. I managed to tell my dad I felt worthless but his response was “that’s normal at your age” and “you’ll feel better soon, just speak to people” but I can’t bring myself to speak to people out of fear of them hating me or me inconveniencing them. I’m really unsure of what I can do, and I feel lost, and all these feelings and emotions have only strengthened since lockdown started as I haven’t spoken to people much and have been alone all the time. And a experience that only strengthened this feeling of loneliness was last night when I was in a call with my friends but they ignored me every time I spoke and I think they forgot I was even there. I’m sorry if this is kinda weird or sounds like a rant or if it doesn’t make sense, I’m just trying to type it up but my head is being weird and my thoughts are fuzzy and I just feel so tired","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
"My boyfriend had recently self harmed, and this has triggered me","The entire time my 24yo boyfriend and I (21F) have been together, he has always suffered with depression and anxiety. He has his good periods and bad periods, and I learnt how to deal with both. He’s off anti depressants, and hasn’t been to therapy in a while. Until a few days ago, he’s only ever told me about his urges, but has never actually self harmed. Then one morning, he told me he had cut himself, and how he was sorry and was really ashamed he had done it. I was supportive towards him, let him cry, and made sure he was okay. But after I had dealt with this, the thoughts of self harm seem to have become more frequent in my head. I have dealt with recurrent self harm thoughts in the past, but I haven’t suffered with them recently. I hope that I never act on these, but if I did I fear that he would blame himself, or think that I acted out to be like him.

Just sadness,"Often times I just feel down and I have no clue why. Like I have friends and a supporting family but I barely talk to any of them when I’m feeling down. Just an hour I talked to a friend i meet online and she told me to try new routines and try to change my mind set from “everything right now is useless and nothing matters” to something else she never told me. But the thing Is that I can’t just change my mind set and that makes me even more sad because I tell myself I can’t be better and almost everyone are better than me. 

But when I meet someone that isn’t better than me I say bad things and push them away to make them feel worse. 

Also recently I find myself starring into nothing or a mirror and just thinking what would happen if I would die and who honestly would care. Also also when I think about this sort of stuff I don’t cry or do anything physical like that I just get sad and keep thinking.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Today I reached my rock bottom,"I flunked the bar twice and what is more painful is that ALL my friends passed. I am happy for them but there is a part in me which thinks I am inadequate for not being able to pass it. Everyone I know, even those who do not do well in law school made it. No comforting words can console me. Every time I take a nap I really I would die. I am even having this evil thought I get corona virus or something.

My sister shouted fake news when she thought I passed. I saw their excitement. My parents ran towards me. But when I said I actually failed again they just turned their back and left. No comfort whatsoever. So now I am all alone. Images of my ex when we were breaking up during my bar review was recurring and his words which go like I have nothing to be proud of. I just proved him right. My friends are all cheering up on me but everything is just cliche. And what do I expect? They cannot mourn with me bec they are all celebrating. 

I am currently employed in a law firm that I love but if I have to take the bar again, I need to resign to pave way for my review. I also don't want to stay because the work would get me reminded that I am not a lawyer. It is heartbreaking to leave a firm I finally love. Then bar in our country is moved to 2021 due to corona virus. I am going to derail my life for 2 years. I am more than delayed. I feel so left out. I see no purpose in life.

"r/Suicidewatch didn't really give me what I needed, so I'm sharing my feelings on this subreddit","My depression has gotten so worse, and I just want to end it all. I can't imagine a future for myself anymore. I had everything going for me before I had depression, but now, I have nothing. I have no friends, and even when I did have friends, all of my conversations were one sided with all of them, and I felt so alone when I was friends with them.

My dad is my only parent. My dad isn't there for me when I'm at my worst, and he's only there for me when I have a high GPA or get all As. I had to convince him for three years that I had an issue when I had a possible anxiety disorder. Recently, I haven't had the best grades due to my worsening depression, and when my dad confronted me about it, I told him that I didn't have the energy to do the work, because I may have depression, and he took my phone away because ""I didn't tell him the whole story"" essentially invalidating my feelings. I've told him two months ago that I thought about suicide, and he ignored me. On my birthday, I attempted suicide, but stopped at the third pill, and tried to tell my dad, and he said I'm doing this all because he took my phone away along with other stuff and yelled at me, essentially he implied that I was doing it for attention. He doesn't care about me when I'm at my worst. My dad always says, ""You've changed since middle school, and in middle school you weren't like this"" whenever I tell him. Nobody really cares about you until you're gone. He'll never understand.

Even the fucking school staff has made my life worse by scolding me for my F in the class in front of all the students, and everyone nearby (which was a lot of people) heard since most of them glanced at me. Even a month later, a girl who was really far away from where me and the counselor were heard and asked about it, and whether I was staying in that class. My English teacher had noticed that I'm no longer turning in assignments and scolded me in front of the class by saying, ""What's wrong with you?! You've changed""

I've lost all hope in life. I've dropped my AP classes for Honors ones, even though I had mainly As in them. I haven't even studied for the one AP class I do have, and I only have it since I'm in an academic program that I can't get out of. The friends that I do have barely talk or text me, and I have to text them if I want to talk to them. My friends give ""dead replies"" like ""yeah"" or are just shy or something, but I can never have a convo with them. The friends that I used to have made me feel so alone. My dad invalidated my feelings. I've been drowning and screaming for help, yet no one has helped. I caught on to my depression so early that it actually had a chance of being cured if I had gotten immediate help.

I did not, and now I feel like dying will make the world a better place for everyone around me. I'll no longer have to make eye contact with old friends, or be a burden to my dad. I'll no longer have to worry about feeling lonely or having one sided conversations anymore. I'll be happier. I don't want to live for anyone, since that is selfish to the person who asks me to live for them, their happiness. I can't picture a future life for me anymore.

I tried telling my old friend about my depression, and she said stuff along the lines of ""I can relate though I don't have depression"". I'm aware that she's trying to connect with me since she doesn't know what to say, but it makes me feel invalidated, like my feelings are just your normal sadness.  
I've called the suicide hotline four times, but all they do is repeat what I say and add ""makes you feel upset, doesn't it?"" Personally, I'd prefer if someone could add some advice or comment as opposed to that, since it felt unhelpful. Whenever my dad yells at me, I feel like if I were gone then he would be happier. My dad yells at me for a lot of things, and it just makes me hate myself for being so inferior, and not being good enough for him. If I was gone, his life would be better, and my friends wouldn't care since they barely talk to me when I'm alive.  


r/suicidewatch people don't even look through new posts, and the one comment I got from posting my feelings there was to come here lmao, and that's probably because there is more engagement on here.

How to love an unwanted child?,"My short story: my mom is a narcissist. I have suffered enough in my life even though I've been always obedient. My relationship with my mom has damaged me, heck it has damaged my whole family. 

Now: I'm married and my husband badly wants kids. He knows my feelings about it (that I don't want any) yet he is still insistent on it. I can't leave him and go back to the hell hole that my narc mom created. My sister also doesn't want kids, so you can see the effects that my mom caused on all of us. 

My issue: How do I love an unwanted child, if I do end up having a kid just to please my husband, because he won't budge. I do love my husband and don't want to leave him. 

They say that you can't control everything, but thinking about becoming a mother gives me anxiety. No one can understand my feelings about this apart from God. 

I don't want to turn into my mother if God forbid I do become one myself.

Tips about how to love an unwanted child, especially if you're a victim of a narc parent, would be very helpful.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
I am so tired,"I have entered this on a different subreddit, but no one seems to be too responsive (besides one person who I am really thankful for). I want to hear more from others....I'm a very introverted person, and I'm smart. I know what I should do to get help, I know what the sources of my problems are, I know what I have to do. But I am so tired.

To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father.Anyways, like I said, I'm a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others- I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude.  So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But it's been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I don't deserve what she gives me- that I don't deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back.Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think it's weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting. Of not feeling good enough for anyone.**I sometimes wish I had a normal life, but look back on it and would rather it be me than anyone else. And I want someone to see that. To not think I am vein or naive, instead looking into me. Looking at my pain, my struggles, my scars, my fighting, and be grateful. To hold me and say it was worth it, that I am strong. To let my tears fall, and look me in the eyes and say ""thank you"".**","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Unbearable sadness - literally feel like I can not go on if I feel like this,"This is a bit rambly and melodramatic but need to feel like someone can hear me out. 

The older I get the more intensely sad I feel. It's like there are always further levels.

Lately I have been feeling less ""numb"" and more an intense wave after wave of sadness.

Today my neighbour played ""Video Games"" by Lana Del Rey and it just started me thinking of loss.

Losing people. If I believe that death/breaking up means goodbye forever, it becomes unbearable to go on.

I had a fight with my first boyfriend. I'm wondering if I could cope with a break up.

I think breakups are harder than losing someone cause they died. Especially if that person was a good person and things just didn't work out. Cause then you keep living with the what-if's.

I'm 23 and life has yet to start properly kicking me in the ass.

depression is getting worse,"this is kind of just rambling but i’ve been depressed for literally as long as i can remember and i cant take it anymore. everyday just feels like a chore to get through. when i meet new people they’re supportive at first but over time they just get annoyed bc it never goes away and they end up leaving, so i’ve just taken to not venting to friends bc it’s only ever made things worse. growing up i was a smart kid and now i’ve failed out of college multiple times and am in extreme debt because of it. i’m stuck living with my parents and all i want is to move out but i can’t hold down a job. i’ve tried every antidepressant available to me as well as multiple kinds of therapy, TMS, partial programs and inpatient. nothing helps. i don’t want to die i just want to be happy but it feels like there’s nowhere to turn. i love life and i love people, the only reason i don’t end everything is because i know how much it would hurt people in my life. i just want to be able to experience happiness and not be so tired everyday and constantly overwhelmed with thoughts of hurting myself. i try so hard every single day to get better and it only gets worse. i’ve called or texted hotlines in the past but it just made me suicidal because it just makes it more obvious there’s nothing that can be done. i think if the coronavirus wasnt going on i’d probably admit myself to inpatient but that doesn’t really seem possible right now. plus when i’ve gone to inpatient in the past they haven’t really helped me, i barely even got therapy they just made sure i didn’t kill myself but didn’t do anything to make those thoughts go away. i’m in so much pain. i don’t know what else to do.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Too much to handle,"Hi. I'm an 18 year old young woman, dealing with a schizophrenic mother. I'm constantly trying to understand what's wrong with her and what's making her do despicable things to me, but I really can't take it, the things she did (and does) to me, and the way she got away with ruining my life, and the way she turned my grandfather against me and making me the bad guy.

I doubt if she ever saw me as a daughter for once, and not just a mere trophy to boast about. She does not care a crap about my need for privacy, she peeks into my phone, my books, my laptop, and what not, every chance she gets. She constantly hurls curses at me even if something goes minutely wrong or her needs and wants aren't satisfied the way she wanted them to be. She has literally told me in the past that she wished my life was ruined by someone, and I get raped by a vile person who would cheat me. Apart from that, I receive other constant curses like, ""you won't live a good life at all, your life will be terrible, you'll burn in hell, your future will be terrible, and your husband will be a bad man"" (okay, first of all, I'm TERRIFIED of relationships, marriage, or anything that has to do with the romantic paradigm. I've even talked to her about this but she can't help but obsess over me getting married, instead of me having a stable career. What's worse? She has no logical reasoning behind this obsession, and tries to sell me to the same institution {marriage} that ruined her and continues to ruin many others!) She yells at me for trivial things, and absolutely despises it when I even look at a person from the opposite sex - heck, she doesn't want me to even talk to MY OWN FATHER! She constantly feels entitled to just barge into my room to deliver two-hour lectures about how she knows what's best for me, and how I should become the ideal daughter that she pictures in her head - a socially awkward, terrible at communicating, family-oriented yes woman, without any inclination towards her career (and even if so, abysmally little interest must be exhibited). First of all, what a hypocritical thing to believe for a woman who'd been to several countries for work, and secondly, why wouldn't she try to put herself in my shoes FOR ONCE? 

She ruined my life by forcing me to join a terrible college, despite me getting accepted into better ones - she blackmailed me by playing a whole bunch of cards - my father's hard work card, my life will get ruined if I don't obey her card, I'm only doing good for you card, and what not - just so she could persuade my dad to buy a new apartment in some random suburb village area. Then came her tantrums to move into the suburb, despite owning a good enough home pretty much within the city. She had absolutely no logical reasons to move, and the only back-up she had were her delusions and the curses she hurled at me . Needless to say, she won again (all I asked from her was two years of time for me to move away from her and leave her to her much-wanted peace from me by graduating from college). She has bad blood and beef with almost all of her and dad's relatives, and the only backup she has is her father, who is a much more aggressive despot, who always thinks he's right, and others (esp who are younger and financially more unstable/dependent) do not have a right to question the decisions he imposed on their lives. My father is said to have been a compulsive liar in the past, and he seems to have reformed now, but he feels incredibly helpless in this situation, despite this suburb house being his property. This quarantine has made the situation pretty much worse, and I really want out, but I don't know whom to go to and seek help from. I've been a victim of constant gaslighting and emotional abuse (my mom believes other third party people more than she believes me, and exhibit A: this happened even when I was sexually harrassed by a driving school instructor, from a school SHE put me in). When I question my mother about her incredibly selfish and narcissistic ideals, and pushing me to be what she thinks is human perfection, she just shrugs it off by saying, ""all humans are selfish, and this is human tendency, and hence my selfishness is justified"". I don't know where to go, or what to do, and the worst part is, in the country where I live, you're legally an adult if you're 18, but you're not really an adult, for you don't get a job without graduating, and you definitely don't get affordable houses on rent with the meagre income you'd earn as a pink collared employee. Oh, and there's no ""move out when you're 18"" thing - people usually live with their parents here.

How do I process a break up with depression and anxiety,"In April, I (25F) blew up on my boyfriend (24M) because his communication was extremely poor and he still had his dating apps. I kept mine to spy on him and until he finally deleted his. In November, he ghosted me because I blew up on him for being online on Badoo. (we met on) My trigger is rejection because I haven’t seen my father in 21 years. I get hysterical because I relive the abandonment and rejection over again I begged for him to come back and he did 3 weeks later. But, I always took the blame. He claimed that he used it to get weed.

Fast forwards to April, the last time I saw him in person he got a notification from Bumble to come back and use the app. He told me he wasn’t using it but I lost it and asked to see if he received a message but he wouldn’t show me. Then, I asked him to delete all the apps on his phone. He claimed he couldn’t get into Badoo because he needed to go through his email to get the password and it would take to long. Then, he didn’t message me for over week, he does this all the time to me. He worked nights and it was a long distance relationship. All I wanted was  “how are you”, “good morning” and “good night” text. I was always the one initiating the conversations. When i complained he would only communicate for 2 weeks and then stop. Also, he was never been there for me.

After this point, I blew up, told him if he couldn’t delete the rest of the dating apps and give me more communication or it was over. He never answered me back. Due to my depression trigger, I freaked out. I begged for him back again. He answered and was quiet again so I  went to his house but never answered. After that, he stopped messaging me. It’s been almost a month. 

I cannot sleep well even though I’m on medication, I get panic attacks, have anxiety all the time about him replying back to me, being alone again, rejection and where my life is heading especially with this virus because I was suppose to move in with him. Everything else was fine with the relationship except for the apps and communication.

I’m in desperate need of truthful comfort...,"I’ve recently turned 18-I have suffered domestic, emotional, mental and formerly physical abuse. As a result I have gotten depression and anxiety, both confirmed by a trained professional. I’ve reached out to my friends, to authorities, but they all treat me as if I need to be punished...I’m truly trying to reach out and the moment anyone’s nice to me I’m so scared to lose them
Now that I’ve gotten older some thoughts have come to hit me like a freight train
Since I was seven I’ve feared of what was to come after death. Bc I knew that most likely it’d be like I never existed. As if I was never born
I know it sounds incredibly stupid but I’ve been researching articles about how far science is from being able to extend our lifespans...but honestly with so many people always either being unable to do much or just choose to punish me, I’m not sure how much longer I can last with this heavy thought of what comes after death
A huge part of me just wants to kill myself and get it over with...
My dog is my only real family, he was with me since I turned five. We grew up together. Once he’s gone and my friends have inevitably moved on with their own lives that’s when I plan to end it. I’m tired of trying when no one can do anything, and I don’t want to live decades with these thoughts hanging over my head
Medication doesn’t help, therapy doesn’t help, authorities told me to quote “Learn your place”...and before any of you say I haven’t found the right therapist, I’ve been to five different ones. Most of whom prescribed different medications
The starvation I have for affection made me fall into the tricks of a pedo.
I suppose I dont blame authorities for shaming me and treating me like a slut....
I just want it to stop

Could this be a temporary effect of the quarantine? Should I still seek therapy?," I've been suffering from depression for about the past year and a half until it escalated a lot in the past couple of months. To the point where two and a half weeks ago, I went to bed and had my first full blown panic attack while going to sleep had to close my eyes to force myself asleep and not face it.

All of a sudden a week later, I woke up and slowly realized throughout the day that I've never felt like that before. The depression everything was completely gone as if someone just snapped a finger. Could this be a result of me being isolated and not facing the world?

I've always had a hard time making friends, but I moved right as quarantine started, I didnt know anyone, I was alone, I lost connection with my friends, except my for my long distance girlfriend, I gave her everything I ever had, all my money, my time, my energy, there wasnt a time where I wasn't there for her, I suppose I got too attached, but, I still made sure she was happy, I helped her with her anxiety/depression, I spent months convincing her parents to get her a therapist, helped her with every problem she had, big and small, got her presents, gave her confidence, and then with the long distance our relationship got rocky, with the isolation with only her to talk to, I got depressed, I talked to her, but she never cared, she never tried to make me fell better, she only cared how she felt, so I was confused how I felt, we went on and off from texting, and then one day her bff texted me how I was toxic, I probably was but didnt see it, but, it still hurt to hear that it was my fault, i only wanted her to be happy and all I got in return was a punch in the face, me and her dated for half a year and I knew her for 3, she was my everything, I didn't have a lot of friends so I gave her all my time, she put herself in front of me, and that what everyone else does, expects me to give them attention, all my life it has been like that, all I am to people is a outlet, if I killed myself no one would care.

I have lost all my friends and am stuck in a nightmare.,"I spent the last 45 minutes carefully putting together my story and tried to tell exactly what happened in the past year, but then the Reddit app decided to commit suicide before me and I am too furious to write all of this shit again, so I'll just get straight to the point:

I have lost all my friends. I get especially sad because even my best friend (we have kissed several times...) just doesn't care anymore.
My mother doesn't support me at all. She even keeps insulting me and makes things a lot worse. I seriously don't want to live here anymore. Or even living in general, but that's not really the point of this sub.
And my father? I don't even know his name. Absolutely no contact whatsoever. 
I have nobody. 
I get insanely sad when I see other people having a good time, because I'm stuck in this nightmare of not having any social contact whatsoever. But hey, at least I mastered social distancing before this Corona thing happened and I have no problem isolating myself... cause that's exactly what I did for the past nine months or so.
I don't even need an ""external trigger"" (like seeing other people having fun) and I just get tears out of nowhere and I constantly think about what has happened to me.
I sometimes don't even go to school because I would see people which mean a lot to me but treat me like a peace of garbage.
I am terrible at school. 

Before Reddit crashes again, I'll just leave this here and yeah suffering is fun.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

How to stop crying all the time?,"Hi there,  


TL;DR : I cry so much and not sure how to calm myself down enough to not cry. I'm not always even sure why i am crying, it just starts running down my face. 

I'm on month 7 of my current severe depressive episode. My bipolar causes me to have usually 6 months of depression every year, but this time it feels worse than in many years, and also it's just getting worse despite having lasted quite a while for my usual pattern. I'm considered treatment resistant with meds, though about to try out a 13th or 14th new medication. I'm also struggling to access adequate support.   
I am crying every day recently, today being particularly bad. I've had 4 or 5 bouts of crying since I got up about 5 hours ago. Nothing has actually happened today, so I don't know why. I'm tired of this. I'd love some ideas on how I can find some more calm. I do yoga in the evenings, but it's a recent thing and I probably have to do it for a while to see improvements.   


On a positive note, I handed in all the medications I no longer take to the pharmacy for safe disposal yesterday. This makes me a lot safer in terms of suicide risk, and whilst it makes me quite anxious not to have it as an ""option"" in the back of my head, I know it was the right thing to do.

Severe anxiety and depression,"Most of my life I have suffered with depression, anxiety, self deprecating thoughts and worse case scenario imagery in my head almost nonstop.  It’s like a movie that never stops playing.  I currently take 120+ mg daily of CBD spread throughout to help manage my symptoms.  

Is there any hope for me to be alright without taking so much medication.  To put it in imagery, It really feels like it’s a python constantly wrapped around my neck and When I take medication, I feel it let go for a while but can also still feel it just sitting there in the corner waiting for it it wear off so it can pounce right back on and keep strangling me.  

I need a long term solution.  it has gotten so bad that I can’t stop taking the CBD for more than a day without experiencing severe mental distress.  Sometimes I cannot even function without it.  When I took CBD for the first time it was also the first time I had ever felt “normal”. I am grateful to have this medication but at the same time I do not want to have to depend on this for the rest of my life.  

I just want the normal brain chemistry that other people seem to take for granted.  Having a normal day for me is so rare its like finding buried treasure for me.  And then I want to stay normal so bad and hold on to that good feeling that ironically, I bring the anxiety back about trying to stay feeling normal.  It almost feels hopeless.  

Is there any hope that I can ever have a normally functioning mind without taking large amounts of medication?

I am depressed and I lost all of my friends. I feel so alone.,"For my entire life, I have dealt with severe persistent depression (dysthymia as the diagnosis) and anxiety. I have gone through a lot of stuff, especially toxic friendships throughout life. These past few months have been especially tough for me. I got involved in a ""relationship"" that didn't end up in a relationship due to his and my own mental instability. He refused to work together on it and trying to work on some things we both had issues with. This made me feel as if he didn't really care about me. Tonight he told me he definitely did not have romantic feelings for me anymore. After that, my best friend (Let's call her Katie) contacted me for help involving her struggling with suicidal thoughts (not necessarily wanting to kill herself, more so that the thought of suicide made her anxious). Anyways, after I helped her to the best of my ability, I felt great. (I want to be a therapist so this is rewarding to me if I can help anyone.) But then, she told me something. I have had this other friend for a long long time. (Let's call her Amy) Throughout high school, Amy and I had issues because her mother absolutely despised me and created issues for our friendship. I am pretty sure she blamed a lot of stuff on me to her mom so she wouldn't get in trouble for it. As a result, I began getting left out of our friend group a lot and was treated like an outcast. She has been a pretty shitty friend to me. Last year, Amy moved away to go to a different college, which made things so much easier for me, life was going great. But this summer she moved back to town and is transferring to our hometown college. Immediately life started going back to how it used to be. Katie hangs out with them a ton and I am just alone and don't really get invited. I ended up saying something to Katie and asked her if she thinks everyone is going to start excluding me again and I said something like, ""Since Amy moved back, everyone flocks to her like she is crack"". This is not a great thing to say but I was frustrated and panicking at the time. Katie was with Amy and another girl at the time, and I thought Katie wouldn't show anyone and this was a private convo (my mistake for thinking that would be true). Tonight, after feeling the gratification of helping her, Katie decided to tell me that the other girl she was with and Amy read what I said. I genuinely didn't say anything super mean, just that I was frustrated that as soon as she moves back, I get dropped. Katie told me the other girl she was with said: ""that is just disrespectful and out of line"". and Amy said, ""I'm glad I know how she really feels about me"". Sorry for the long story but now, I just feel like nothing. I feel that I mess up every friendship. But at the same time, I am frustrated with the fact that if they do anything to hurt me, it means nothing, but if I do anything I am automatically this horrible human being. They act as if they have done nothing to me. I left my group message with all my friends, which was my main source of support and I stopped talking to the boy who finally told me he has lost all romantic feelings for me. (He talked to me every day for about a month after he ""ended things"" and said he still had feelings for me for the longest time). I feel so alone and like I have hit rock bottom once again. I feel suicidal but I know myself enough to know I won't do anything. I don't want to die; I want the pain and hurt to stop. I just wish people would care for me the amount I care for them. I wish people actually understand that they hurt me and, not to be self-centered, but put themselves in my shoes for just a second.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

I haven't feel myself in a while, all my days are blue. No objective, illusions, little things get to amused me, I don't like how I look, I feel like I'm in a boat without paddles....spinning around with no direction.

I lost my job and potentially my career due to a deep depression.,"Hello,

I (27F) am using my alternative account because there are people who are trying to hurt me with anything they can find out about me. 

I was diagnosed with Anxiety, depression, and Bipolar disorder at the age of 11 and have always struggled, but I functioned for the most part. A little over a year ago, I was in the darkest place of my life. My dad had just had a major heart attack/stroke/aneurism and was destined to die according to doctors (he beat the odds with months of comas/therapy). My favorite aunt had committed suicide and left my two high school aged cousins motherless. Most terribly though, my ex had blindsided me and illegally started a child custody battle to take my only child, a 7 year old, away from me who I have raised his whole life. I spent all my personal investments/savings, $15,000, to hire a top attorney and was left broke and completely shattered. My partner was there to support me as much as he could so my son an i had a roof over our head but i was suffering. 

Shortly before this all happened, I had completed my 1 year internship at a major Financial Firm &amp; had gained my Series 7 &amp; Series 66 FINRA licenses. I was so proud of my accomplishments, salary, and stability after 10 years of customer service and sales jobs that did not provide full stability. I was so happy, the happiest I had been in a long time, and then everything came crashing down at the same time.

I  had an amazingly supportive boss who helped me every step of the way until I exhausted my PTO, UTO, FMLA, Short Term Personal Leave and he had run out of options to offer me. During all this time, I was nothing but a husk. I wouldn't leave my bed, eat, shower, and I spent hours just sleeping. My partner didn't know what to do and Psychiatrist were unavailable due to a large shortage in my city (over 6 month waits and up to 9 months). I refused to go to an inpatient facility because I knew it would hurt my child custody case but at the time, that probably would have been the best option. This went on for over 3 months. Eventually, i got the call i was expecting, with cracks in his voice, my boss informed me that HR had declined any further leave and that I was being let go for violation my companies attendance policy. I was heartbroken, but numb. My year internship had been for nothing now, my countless hours of studying for my FINRA exams, all my efforts were gone because i couldn't bare to face the world. It was another punch to the gut when I received my U5 in the mail, something that stays with your for the rest of your Financial industry career, stating I had been fired for not following attendance policies. 

Fast forward to 2 months after everything, I was able to get on my partners insurance and pay $500 out of pocked for a psychiatrist. I was put on mood stabilizers and further diagnosed with BPD as well. I had officially run out of handouts from my partner and I had to get a new job back in the industry I despised. I was making $15/hr (I used to have a salary of about $75K Base) and I am miserable. Im not making enough money, and I am terrified to apply for any financial services job that will see my U5 and just move on to the next candidate. Im starting to feel that if I stay at my current job/industry, i will fall right back into that deep depression. My new job offers amazing insurance and I am able to see a therapist and psychiatrist which I am seeing regularly but I don't know if insurance benefits are a reason to stay at a company if you are absolutely miserable. I just want some advice, guidance. I would love to go back to school or get a certification but I'm just getting stabilized financially again and I just cant. I really don't know where to go from here.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
"16, no friends, balding, gaining weight, lonely and depressed.","I sit here and type this at 1:54 am because I can’t sleep. Guys I need help. I’m so broken. So lonely. I’m inside all day and alone, there’s just so much more to say but I’m tired of saying and not getting any help or feeling better.

Now that we’re in quarantine at home I’m not at school but when I was at school people would say I’m weird and lonely.

Struggling,So I have always struggled with depression but after I had met my husband 8 years ago I started doing really well and for the most part didn't have depression. We were always doing stuff to keep busy and keep my mind off the stuff that would bring me down. Well fast forward to now and I am just feeling at the end of my rope. My health took a 180 about two years ago and I now struggle with quite a few health problems that keep me from doing the things I use to do. I cant even do simple things that a lot of people take for granted. And now I see what toll it is taking on my husband to have to take care of me so much and it kills me. He has become so short and angry at the world and has made comments that make me feel like I am to cause for all this. ( I am sure that is not how he feels just how it makes me feel) I just wish I could make all the pain and hurt go away. I feel myself slipping further and further away and I don't know how to cope anymore. Just wish I could quit feeling like this all the time.

FIRE!!!," I can't take anymore stress. Anymore loss. I've had enough. I've fallen so deep into a depression that I've completely let myself go. And I mean completely. I barely have the energy or drive to crawl out of bed. There is no function in my life anymore, I'm simply existing.

I am pretty much alone now. I've lost everything. I have had nonstop loss and stress since June of 2018 and it's not letting up. I'm at the point now to where if I'm lucky enough to sleep, I'll wake, up wondering who in my life is going to die that day or what terrible thing is going to happen.
at's what it feels like. Like I'm outside of myself watching
The last straw was the breakup of my 9 year live in relationship. He came home from work and dumped me out of the blue. He moved out 3 days later, leaving me with our large rental house, it's utilities and other bills. We split everything and I've had to take over his share. My elderly mom lives here with me and her income helps but she is ill and is now developing either Dementia or early Alzheimers.

I loved my ex so much and his loss alone has nearly put me under. It's been 9 mos since he walked and I found out he had been cheating online. Well that's over and now he has a new girlfriend, my worst nightmare was the day I was going to have to see that. She has money and I really think that's the only reason why he's with her, which is sad. We have stayed in touch mostly by text and he sees our animals we owned together. Now that he has her he no longer wants to see all of our animals and doesn't want to talk to me. He told me it hurts him to talk to me. Yeah right!!! I may be severely depressed but I'm not stupid.

Add the Covid stress to everything I've had to deal with and I feel like I'm losing it. I've never gone this long without a shower. I've never gone days at a time without sleep. Sometimes I'll go 4 days without eating.

God help me.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Has anyone been able to get anti depressants online?,"So my issue is I was seeing a therapist for a while and she concluded that I need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist for medication. She suggested wellbutrin since there's a lower risk of decreasing your libido since my depression and anxiety really killed that department. I've done talk/cognitive therapy for years, but at this point medication is going to be necessary.

The one psychiatrist in my area that was accepting clients had their partner retire and took on all of their patients and no longer had any appointments available.

I want to slit my wrists but I know the consequences.,"So basically at the beginning of the year I started slitting my wrist because I started feeling overwhelming depression after 2019. My mum saw the marks and told me to stop. At the beginning of quarantine my depression took another increase, and for two days I started slitting my wrist (again) until my mum saw. She demanded that I tell her what was wrong, and I just told her I feel generally depressed (all the reasoning behind it is complicated and plus I don't feel comfortable telling her). She asked me if a boyfriend had broken up with me or something, and that definitely wasn't the reason (so I assume if she knows I'm depressed she'll think that). She then demanded that I don't slit my wrists again, and therefore I know that if I do, I'll get into a bunch of crap I don't wanna be in. I really wanna start doing it again; I'm a horrible person (so I deserve it) and hurting myself makes me feel better for some reason. I've always felt guilt and shame, and self hatred, and I feel like my life has reached 'the end of the line'; I feel true happiness has faded, and the realisation has struck, that life is completely worthless and I will die one day, leaving everything behind. All motivation seems gone, and my life has just gone to shit, comparing it to the past. I really want to slit my wrist, but I know my parents would see. So what do I do? How do I cut myself and 'get away with it'? Can I cover it up without raising suspicion? I really want to. I feel desperate, but I know I can't.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
I wish I wasn’t so worried all the time. I wish I was actually brave for once. I wish I didn’t always think about what others think about me. I wish I could let go of the past. But I can’t.,"For the longest time, I’ve had this dream that I’ll be a musician. Singing songs and making people happy. Making myself happy. I’ve wrote songs before, I’ve played many instruments before, I’ve spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while. In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. 

I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music.


Even with drawing, which I put my heart and soul into, I still long for music.


Even when sewing, I sing. 


Even when I’m outside, I sing and sing and cry. Because I’m so weak.

I’m weak because I couldn’t sing in front of others. I’m weak because I’m so shy. I’m weak because I couldn’t even sing properly with my singing teacher. I never let go.


I’m so mad at myself. I want to let this dream go, but I don’t at the same time. Isn’t it enough for me? Art, drawing, and sewing? Why do I still cling to music? I can’t sing. I sound horrible when I’m standing in front of people. My legs shake and I cry. I can’t even sing outside anymore, because I’m afraid of neighbors hearing. I can only sing with headphones on because even I judge myself. I’m my worst enemy. 



Why do I STILL want to sing? Why do I still find myself singing when I can? Why can’t I just let this stupid dream go? This stupid worthless dream. I’m going to art school to draw, which I’m still bad at. I’m not going for music. 


I want to let go of song. But I don’t at the same time. I’m stuck yet again. I don’t know why I’m here.

Do you fall out of love when you're depressed? Please. Anyone.,"My boyfriend and I had been together for 7 months. He first mentioned he was struggling in January with depression and needed to figure it out but had never felt that way before. We were still happy and talking all the time but I could feel him distancing himself still but he wasn't emotionally just physically.  Then coronavirus hit...I saw him right before he went back to work in the beginning of it all, he had taken a vacation for 3 weeks when it was starting. After that last time I saw him, it wasn't for another week and a half until I saw him again and he was totally different. He was irritable, quiet, just NOT himself at all. During the time I didnt see him he hadn't seen his children either and it broke him. He broke up with me a week later when I saw he had basically broken down and mentioned he should get some help because he was different and suffering horribly.  He said he needed to get better and it wouldn't be fair to me to wait. 2 weeks after ending things I asked if he still loved me and he said he didn't.  He cut off all emotion from me. This whole time I'd been trying to help him, was supportive, gave him sites to read up on it, got him to tell his mother, and also got him to reach out to a therapist through the fire department.  My question is...did the depression make him stop loving me? Did he actually stop loving me or is it masked by his depression? Will he come back? Im drowning in despair and want the man of my dreams back. What do I do? Each time I've seen him since that last day before he ended things he has been shutting off more and more...and eventually wouldnt see me anymore. Please someone help. I don't know what to do anymore for him. Or even know if he really just doesnt love me. :/","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Forcing yourself to do things you normally love during depression,"I’m in the midst of a 5 week bout with depression, which for me has nothing to do with sadness. Rather, depression for me is a horrifying head fog that *disconnects* me from all emotions, interests and appetites. All I can feel is the fear and anxiety of being in this state of mind. If you suffer from this flavor of depression, or any flavor, do you force yourself to do the things your normally love even though you can’t connect with that feeling of enjoyment? For me, doing this and not getting the reward makes it all worse, but I also don’t wanna wait around to feel better to do these things, If that makes any sense.

I'm getting angry at my depression. I want to break out of it and I can't seem to shake it.,"There are tons of various things that have contributed to my mental state at this age. Abusive parents with narcissistic personality disorder, running around with bad friends, I was molested (sort of, and publicly), starting drugs in middle school and becoming addicted by highschool, heavy psychedelic use, and whatever quirky autistic spectrum disorder or attention disorder caused school to be so overwhelming for me growing up.

 I want to feel better, that's for sure. But I look at ""normal functioning"" and it doesn't match my ideal for what a human life should be. I've looked down on ""normalcy"" for a long time because it leads to brainwashed non-individuals, not questioning yourself, and honestly I think it limits our evolution. I don't like where the world is going and it alienates me in addition to my mental state. 

These past couple of months I have reverted to terrible behaviors and failed a lot. I failed one of my college courses (I had a 3.7 gpa prior), I've been blowing up at work and unable to get my work done properly, on my days off I either lay in bed all day or smoke a bunch of weed and drink and party with friends (I can't have fun without substances and havent even since I quit hard drugs like opiates and benzos 4 years ago), I tell myself to get it together and I just don't have the willpower because I'm not happy about my opportunities in life. I'm going to school to become a teacher, before this I had a 2 year existential crisis where I didn't want to do ANYTHING and I would become psychotic and suicidal, I just hated everything in life and I felt like I had tasted multiple ways of living and none of them resonated with me. Now I feel like this again. My routine was interrupted by covid-19 and even though I was still a mild nicotine addict and had a mental breakdown during every homework assignment, I would push myself. 

Now I feel like I've backslid and I'm right where I was  2 years ago. I wasn't able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep. I did a few assignments and it would take me half the day to write a 2 page paper. Took me a week to write a 6 page paper. I used to be able to do them in a few hours. I feel like my mind is deteriorating. 

Conversation is more difficult. I can easily explain my feelings because it's a trait of my personality, but casual talk and reading people has become impossible. I'm getting anxious because talking to people I already know is starting to feel like talking to strangers. I've been crying my eyes out over small insecurities I used to be over and accept. 

I'm trying to figure out how to reorganize my life but it's so hard. I know people who go out and party and drink night after night and still go to college and go to work and are doing great. They are happy and healthy and only have a small nagging guilt about not getting more done. I feel like I produce NOTHING of value to the world and it's so difficult to just chip away at learning a song or doing a simple assignment or task at work. 

All I can listen to is super depressing music as well if I want to enjoy it. I feel like a emo highschooler. 

My whole life I've struggled with motivation, my parents called me a lazy piece of shit everyday and it's true. Everything takes so much mental effort for me and I can barely focus because my mind goes a million miles an hour with intense imagery and nonsensical logic. To slow it down and focus on the world around me, especially the physical world, is a manual effort. The depression just makes it all the worse.

I feel lost and disappointed in myself,"I’m (23F) I went to a 4-year after high school, for 2 and a half years, struggled to find friends and did terribly in school but I stayed nonetheless??? I regret that so much because I spent most of my time sick because I had no one to take care of me. I continued going there for 2 and a half years? When J was almost miserable thinking it would get better.. i had a close friend there who eventually didn’t want to be my friend anymore and I felt so alone away from my family. No one cared about me, why did I stay? Eventually I left of course, but why did I continue to go there for 2.5 years when I wasn’t performing well and didnt fit in with people at all? Is this the same reason people stay in abusive relationships? 
Now, 2-3 years later, after working and going to community college, I’m transferring this fall. I thought I would be able to get a second chance at “college” but this pandemic happens and my classes are online. 
I still feel so much abandonment after my friend left me in college. I felt like I put so much into them, and they left me. 
I feel like I’m disappointing my family because they had high hopes for me, but I still haven’t proved myself to them. 
I’m just so lost in my life.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think my mother is toxic,"She’s always been abusive (most of the times verbally and emotional) but she’s worst than ever this last 2-3 years. I started living with her 4 or 5 years ago, she didn’t want that responsibility and gave me to my grandma. She never really cared about me and never gave me emotional support, however, she always told others how “succesful” i was at school etc. As soon as the others are gone she starts blaming me for everything, even breathing stupid( whatever that means :/). She makes fun of everything about me and tells me i’m never gonna be happy or succesful in life. She always curses at me and if i tell her that she misunderstood me she’d beat me. She often tells me that i drain her energy everytime she’s near me even though i always try to look happy and full of energy because i don’t want her to be sad because of me. She thinks i hate her but i don’t. I should maybe, i don’t know, i just can’t since she gave birth to me and looked after me. She gave me money so i could eat. But she always told me bad stuff and made fun of me. She abuses me everyday and makes me feel bad every time. I try not to tell her anything she’d be angry about even the way i look at her makes her angry. My existence makes her angry. I thought about ending my life so many times but the people i love comes to my mind, especially my caring boyfriend. I don’t want to make anyone sad but i want my mom to be happy. My parents are divorced so i think about living with my dad but he’s in another city and can’t come here until the virus is not a problem anymore.

I got into rpg commu to escape reality but It made my depression got worse.,"I'm 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesis's topic is hard and it's stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and role-playing with other's character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and it's like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didn't active much because of my works and I'm kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill (I'm part-time freelance artist.)  But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didn't reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe they'll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But there's one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didn't know I'm the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didn't talk to me since. I know it's stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But it's so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air.

A happy lonely girl,"I have a girlfriend and she was diagnosed with clinical depression. She always seems happy, she likes to make corny jokes and we always enjoy each other.
But there will always a day she will tell that she feels alone, that she hates herself that she can't even look herself in the mirror and says that she's a burden to everyone. It really hurts me everytime I hear those words from her. I always try my best to comfort her, even though I'm not with her physically I will talk to her over the phone without hanging out the phone and watch her until she fell asleep because that's the only thing that I can do. 
Worst feeling is I don't know what to do or what to say to cheer her up whenever she feels that extreme sadness. Also even in regular days, she can't accept compliments.
I love her so much that I want to be with her in always. I want to be her shoulder whenever she feel sad. I am not that knowledgeable about how to handle things like this so I'm seeking some tips or anything that can help me help her in her battles.

Could someone offer some advice on how to be a functioning adult?,"I've been depressed my entire life. Because of this, I've spent all of my time doing what was required of me such as homework, taking care of basic needs such as eating or sleeping, and mindlessly refreshing social media or the news. I have no hobbies or interests or skills or ability to take care of my mental wellness. I can probably survive on a physical level- I know how to work, how to pay taxes, how to pay bills, how to get in contact with someone to rent an apartment, that sort of thing. But I have no idea how to stop being so miserable all of the time. I can't keep a job without feeling suicidal almost every day because I need to work (although I force myself to keep one anyways), I can't pick a future career path, I can't motivate myself to pursue hobbies, I can't even do things that make me feel happy because nothing really does as far as I know. What I'm asking is: how do I stop just surviving and start living? How do I fit a fulfilling life around all of this stress and overwhelming deadlines and responsibilities? How do I actually be an adult? I can do the basic things I need to in order to keep my physical body alive, but I have no idea how to do anything beyond that.

"To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways.","My mom just got high blood pressure today. And it's my fucking fault.

Since I don't live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy.

Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her life's mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said ""I'm fine."" Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to tell you. I'm sorry.

Within the several days, my mom *really* tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didn't let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldn't swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like they're lying, that it's their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and *so much time.* 

I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger I'd hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We don't get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too.

My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. She'd take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and she'd spread it all over my arm where I'd hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long see-through sash, and she'd tie and secure it on my arm so I don't pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, I'd always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me.

Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brother-in-law. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room (no electronics in my room), and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an all-nighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didn't like me using because they didn't use it and found it a waste of time (the apps were things like TikTok and some games). While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldn't vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer (which was in the living room, and I didn't want to see their faces). So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs + 2-3 layers of skin. It wasn't bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. 

Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was (I had cried a few times earlier) and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 2-3 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and that's when we decided to bring her to the ER.

On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she could've gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasn't my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, that's the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens.

Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.

I feel so bad. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm just wondering if my mom really needs a child like me. Maybe she's better off with my older sister and her perfect husband and perfect child. I stand out in the picture anyways.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Both me and my spouse are depressed,"To sum things up, my husband works in retail, I'm disabled and can't get disability pay, we're poor, but getting by, neither of us have any schooling nor can afford it, he doesn't know what he wants to do if he does go to school, while I feel if I decide to go, it would be a waste of money because I won't be able to work. Plus, there's no guarantee I'm mentally fit for it. Neither of us have any drive or passion for life and the only thing really keeping both of us going is each other.

We're both obese because he's too tired after work to do anything and my condition is sporadic so it's unsafe for me to walk alone. Neither of us even want to go anywhere, anyways. We eat for comfort or when we're bored and neither of us can really muster the effort to make food a lot of the time so we subsist on junk. Little things tire us out easily (me from my condition, but us both from depression).

I'm diagnosed and receiving treatment, he isn't. Because of the pandemic, therapy for me is spotty at best - just went three months without therapy and had my first session last week, but my therapist missed our last session earlier this week, so I'm worried she's sick again. Getting my husband in for therapy or psychiatry right now is impossible. New patients aren't being accepted because paperwork needs to be signed in person. 

We do have a dog, but he fits in with us way too well. Our dog is afraid of the outside if he's out more than 10 minutes, then demands to be picked up or he won't move. He enjoys car rides and likes being held for walks but my back and heart can't take the position, and he doesn't want my husband to hold him - he's my velcro dog. Then if there are any people, dogs, noises, or wind, he starts to panic, so I do too, he usually helps stabilize my moods, but we're both afraid of people so it turns into a feedback loop. He's house trained because most of the time, even when I get him hyped up to go outside and put his leash on, he just freezes at the door and refuses to go outside, and if I pick him up and put him down on the grass he just stands there.

We live in a trailer park and our yard is about 10 feet wide, so there's no privacy. We both are hermits and don't like interacting with people and I'm autistic so I just... can't converse verbally normally. We have no friends locally even though we've been here for a few years. I just got out of a bad friendship and at this point can't really be bothered to try to have another friend in fear I'll get myself in the same situation.

On top of everything, I'm going through an existential crisis and find no comfort in my hobbies I used to enjoy. Neither of us really do anything. We play video games and I draw, but that's about it. I have suicidal tendencies but haven't tried for a while, but have been close to downing pills again. He isn't suicidal per se, but when he's at work he gets thoughts akin to ideations, but when we're together we're both fine.

At this point, I honestly don't know what to do. Sure, there's plenty of stuff to be done, but I have issues prioritizing things, so I just see this long list and get overwhelmed and end up doing nothing. Our pets and plants still get cared for, and I can do some house chores (our place is a fixer upper to say the least), but most of the day I just sit in paralyzing existential dread. I'm too dead set on rationing my medicine (from trauma) that I either won't allow myself to take my sedatives even when I should or am scared that I'll have the urge to eat them all and kill myself. Don't overdose, kids, it ain't as romantic as the movies make it out to be.

It just feels hopeless. It's like we weren't meant for this world. I'm lucky I found him because I have no doubt that I wouldn't be here today without him, but I'm scared that I'm making him worse, that I can't help him get up and do things because I myself can't motivate myself to do the same thing. I always feel like a burden, even though he insists that he doesn't think of me that way. I just want to make him happy. I want him to have a good life.

But I don't know how to do that, and even if I did, I'm afraid I wouldn't be capable regardless.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
24/7 Brain Fog from Depression?,"Hi guys, hope you are all doing well and are having a great day.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 20 year old whose been struggling with depressive thoughts for 2 years. I think I am gradually getting better at it but I've been pretty much stuck with this symptom since it started and I don't know how to get rid of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I pretty much have brain fog nearly all day, every day. My mental clarity has completely evaporated. I can't seem to focus on things and analyzing complex ideas for me now is very difficult. I sometimes feel like my IQ level has plummeted. I used to be a smart student in school with great focus and motivation, but now I've changed for the worse. I feel much stupider. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to fix this?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know why I feel this way,"I pulled out my notepad and no words come out of me. I tried putting myself in front of my piano, but I can't bring myself to even play a full piece. The one that I've tried is mediocre at best. I can't pick up a book. I can't bring myself to enjoy the foods I eat.

I don't even know why I feel this way. There is no reason for me to feel this way. I have a roof over my head, a loving family, and supportive friends, yet why do I feel this way?

There are people that say they love and care for me, but why can't I bring myself to pull up the phone to say ""Hi""? I know they'd reply back, but I don't know why I can't do it. There is a voice in my head that says they hate you. They never cared for you. They only tolerate you because they see you as a sad being. I know it's not true, but why does my mind work against me?

And now, I'm lying on my bed. I don't even want to do anything. I just want to lie down and try to sleep.

I can't even do sleeping right. Sometimes, I sleep too much. Sometimes, none at all.

And all I could do to shut my thoughts to play is some mindless video or song. But I never really enjoy it.

The saddest thing for me is... I thought I already survived it. I've been out of my medications for two years now, and yet, here it comes again.

I don't like feeling this way. What does it feel like to not have a noisy brain that feeds me with depressive thoughts? It's like every waking moment of my life, it has something to say.

And I hate it.

I just want to feel genuine happiness again.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1

How to stop feeling so tired all the time?,"Quarantine has been rough on me so far. It's practically been undoing months of therapy for me.

I don't know how to stop feeling so exhausted from not doing anything. It's hard for me to even pick up my iPad to work on my illustrations. I have a hard time even thinking about getting up and I end up taking an unnecessary nap.

Im not sure If Im depressed or if i’m just sad.,Pls help Im writing this while sitting on my floor next to my bed in front of my vent because its the place I feel calmest right now. Ive been trying to figure out for a really long time if im actually depressed or if its just because its so popularized now and that its just how everyone feels. I dont have prolonged sadness and I dont feel it every second but some days are terrible. Both my mother and sister have depression and have had it all their lives. I used to go to counseling for anxiety in like 5th and 6th grade but I stopped because I started to feel better again but the first winter of 7th grade I got really “sad” and I was told it was just seasonal which it was for about 3 years. When the winter of my sophomore year came it was different because I was always sad but didn’t know why. I tried to find reasons but I could so I decided not to go to therapy or something like that. and now summer going into my senior year and I just feel empty. The “seasonal” sadness never left after that year and I find myself all the time just feeling blank. I dont really have good thoughts anymore and Ive turned into kind of a pessimist which sucks to say. Im afraid to talk to anyone in person about it besides my mom because people just say im soft or weak. Im just trying to figure out if its just me being brainwashed by social media into thinking im sad or if Im actually depressed.

"Depression, procrastination and graduation","Hello, that's my first post ever on reddit.

I am in huge trouble and I put myself there now I need to face this but I don't know what to do.

I always had panic attacks and alot of stress since I was just a child. but when I started university it doubled and I came to the point last year where I couldn""t get out of bed, let alone study.  I closed myself off and didn't get out of my room for a month, That had consequences on my grades and that made me hate myself even more. 

I used to be very disciplined, a grade A student so that felt like a punch to the guts.Anyway, this year I have a graduation project I need to work on. I thought I learned from that past experience but I really didn't.I was procrastinating out of fear for 5 months now. whenever I start I just start trembling and can't concentrate on anything I'm reading. that led me to withdraw from poeple, my teacher my friends because I'm too ashamed of my behaviour and I can't face them. 

I'm in deep shit I want to get out of this but I don't know how.   This is not how I thought my life and my view towards myself turn out .

Guilty,"Hi. This is my first time posting, but I'm a long time lurker on a lot of communities. I'm 29F, single Pisces.

I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and ADHD.

There are days when I can barely get out of bed.
There are days when I can't even bring myself to shower at least once.

I look at myself in the mirror with shame and disgust.

I constantly have too many obsessive thoughts on many varied topics and situations.

I spend way too much time on my phone trying to live vicariously through scrolling on social media and lurking to see what people I know are up to.

There's honestly not even a coherent thought to this post.

Most of these things I've written are things I've hardly said out loud.

I try not to think too hard and self examine because I'm scared of what I'll see or realize.

I try to keep myself busy by cooking and baking and reading.

I'm trying to stay alive everyday.

My friends and family are not aware of how I feel.

I take antidepressants every day but I feel like they're not enough.

Is there anyone else out there who can relate?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
My Twin Sister Wants To Take My Life Away From Me Including My Dream,"I have a dream that one day i'll get married with a man that will appreciate me for who I am and what I'll be thinking; and accept me for who I am.

I want to be accepted for who I am.

Husband triggered depression by sitting on bed with daughter,"So my father and  I have had some innapropriate interactions over the years. Based on this and working in a field that is very aware of the high frequency of sexual abuse, I have tried really hard to raise my daughter with some modesty boundries to help protect her from grooming by predators. She is 14.

At this age I have discussed this many times with my husband away from our daughter. He often gets what I would describe as vey ""chummy"" with her. Sitting very close, to do things, resting his arm on her leg and his voice changes pitch like he is playfully flirting and will even bat his eyes at her.

I have repeatedly told him how uncomfortable it makes me and how the same behavior from my dad has really bothered me all these years and how horable it is to put a kid in a position to have to tell her father to give her space. Also it really triggers my depression.

But, I would say the behavior has not stopped in any frequency.

I am in a very bad bout of depression now. I started crying and tried to go to bed. But, they were on the bed looking at old photos. I walked out and walked back in to non verbaly hint that something was wrong. My husband acknowledged the look, but went back to what he was doing. I said I had to go to bed, it was very late. My hasband took our daughter and left, but I was so upset, I asked our daughter to please go to bed, it was getting pretty late. 

I did this because I wanted to talk privately with my husband about the issue. He exploded and says I am just poisoning my daughter against him. 

No concern about my depression or grooming concerns, just pure anger. He said he talked to his friends and everyone thinks I am trying to turn our daughter against him, based on this event.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

What would be the best way to talk to my S.O. about getting help tomorrow when it's a really upsetting subject for her even though she needs it?,"Ok, so me and my S.O. are both 15, I am a male and she is a female if that helps at all. Recently, my S.O. has been getting worse and worse and blocking out/getting rid of anyone or anything that helps her or makes her happy and I'm extremely worried about her. 

She took up cutting about 2 years prior, even back then I knew her and did all I could, but eventually it came down to me calling the authorities to save her when she threatened to kill herself one night and her parents sent her to a mental hospital for awhile, which yes, while it did make her stop when she got out (for awhile) the things she got away with and did in there are absolutely horrible and I'm disgusted by the way mental hospitals go about ""helping"" their patients. 

So anyways, recently she picked it back up again, I'd say about a month to a month and a half ago. I've been doing everything in my power to help her stop and I got her to for like 1 maybe 2 weeks at most before an event occurred in which she got her phone taken away by her parents and started it up again because I couldn't be there for her. 

She also most likely has an eating disorder, I say this because one moment she is eating/snacking just chillin, the next shes throwing it all up and going days on end without eating. Shes claimed it has nothing to do with being fat (shes under 90 pounds) but yet she still brings up eating ""like a pug"" or not wanting to ""get fat"" so I assume that may be her reasoning but it could be more. She tells her parents (who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw) that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it. 

She also has terrible mood swings, one minute shes happy, joyful, playful, laughing, the next shes depressed, crying, suffocating herself in her blanket, cutting herself..... (this is all over facetime because her parents are not allowing me to see her as they are very strict) so her mood just changes out of nowhere and whenever I try to bring up her needing help or asking if somethings wrong she gets really upset. She's terrible at taking care of herself and has proclaimed many times ""I hate myself, that's why"" but never goes into detail. She names many things about herself that she ""hates"" but I dont think those are why she does everything she does, and if it is that's why I suggest for her to get help but she refuses all the time. 

She never eats, never drinks water, barely sleeps, does everything she can when shes sick to make herself worse such as drinking coffee and staying up, she never takes her medication, she purposely hurts herself, she doesnt open up, she doesnt respect her own values and boundaries, hell she threw away her inhaler because of whatever reason but she needs it so she doesnt die from a coughing fit due to her thyroidism, which she doesnt do anything to help either. She never allows herself to warm up when shes cold, she suffocates herself in a blanket, she doesnt take her meds for it, it's sad more than it is upsetting if I'm being honest. 

Lately she has been getting rid of/blocking out people who are helping her, which is why I'm glad I convinced her to let me talk to her about this tomorrow, but anyways she convinced her stupid ass useless parents that she doesnt need a therapist anymore, she doesn't tell her doctor anything, she doesnt open up to her parents (understandable because they get mad or brush it off. Dude FUCK them honestly) and she's even blocked me a couple times for spam calling her when she attempted to cut herself (134 deep wound cuts caused by an army knife her dumbass parents never took away btw because I couldn't reach her and her parents for SOME reason trust her home alone) and she's pushed away friends too. 

So with all this information, can someone please give me advice on what I need to address, how I should go about it, and what I should suggest she needs help for like therapist, family therapy, psychologist, etc.?

Am I the Only One?,"Hi, I’m somewhat new to the Reddit community but feel somewhat comfortable discussing heavy topics. So, please please don’t be mean. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for a long time now but just recently got diagnosed and have been getting help for it. To keep it short, when I keep heavy thoughts bottled up inside for too long I explode. For me, I started cutting a year ago but haven’t done it in a few months but prefer to hit my face. I’ve done this for a while but not to the point of leaving a wound. However, recently I’ve noticed that I leave noticeable bruises on my face. I can’t control the rage and feel awful afterwards but then i want to do it again. When it gets to a certain point, I’m suicidal and tend to somewhat blackout when I hit myself. I hate thinking about this but it happened recently and now I have a bruise under my eye. I’m reaching out to see if anyone else does this. Every time I do this, I wear a lot of makeup or stay home because I’m ashamed and embarrassed that I did this to myself. I haven’t told anyone besides my boyfriend, counselor, and doctor so I don’t know what others think about this.

End of my rope,"I'm so overwhelmed and can't take anymore. This pandemic has created hardships I never anticipated. My husband was layed off over a month ago and still haven't received one penny of unemployment. During this chaos, we also found a small infestation of bed bugs so we had to pay a fortune to get rid of them or else be evicted. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm feeling hopeless. The one thing that helped my depression immensely was working out at the gym which has now closed permanently.

I don’t know how I should feel,"My life has been weird recently. Some good things have happened, but also some shit things have happened. 

For example, I managed to put on weight which is incredible, and I am now eating 3 meals a day (up from one and a snack when I was at uni). Also, I’ve managed to re-connect with some old friends from school, which I didn’t think would ever happen. 

But on the flip side, people I cared about have decided to leave my life over the last few weeks, using either their own or my mental health as their reasoning. I’ve also had an ex who cheated on me and sexually assaulted me try re-enter my life by messaging some of my friends. 

At the minute, I’m feeling as down as ever. I have reasons to, but I also have reasons not to. So, I can’t help thinking ‘I shouldn’t be feeling this or thinking like this’ and beating myself up about it.  I think I should be happy, but I just never seem to be. I don’t really know how to think or how I should be feeling anymore. 

I don’t know what to do about all this, I’ve used all the counselling my uni offered me, and also some from a trade union. I can’t afford to go private, so that’s now out of the picture. I’m really stuck on anything I can do about this way of thinking.

What is wrong with me,"This is a very long post and I'm sorry for that. I just hope someone reads it and gives me their honest opinion. I also hope this is the right place for it, if not then, I'll keep this to myself. Thank you all.

Hi, I'm a nurse student in Germany and I'm currently trying to learn for my exam that's in about a month, while trying to find a job at a hospital. not always, but a lot of the elderly I work with call me the ""nice sister"" I'm not an examined nurse yet, and I also don't compare myself with one, but elderly call almost every female worker a sister. I didn't quiet leave a good impression at every unit i worked at, some told me that I should work on my structure, some told me that I need to smile more because my face always looks angry, and some told me that I should apply for a job at their unit because they thought I was good. 
I did apply, wasn't really confident that I'm good at all but i tried my best to seem confident, because I figured that no one would want to hire someone that's not confident. I applied to meet someone that's known to be very nice and that would talk to students for at least 10 minutes and then offer them a job, but I was unlucky enough to have a meeting with someone else, Mrs.D. 
My meeting didn't go that well, she asked me a lot of trick questions and lasted for over 45 minutes, she also asked the ""why should we hire you and not someone else"" question 4 times because she didn't like my answer, come to think of it, I don't think I answered the question at all and talked instead about what this job meant for me. at the end she told me she'd talk to my teacher and the units I've been at, and give me a call soon. 
fast forward one month later, which was yesterday. I was invited to her office mid-shift. she sat me down at a table 2 meters away from her and said we could take off the face masks. then she offered me a limited contract for 6 months and called it my ""second chance"", proceeded to tell me that the units didn't say good things about me and then told me that I'm empathyless and that people aren't machines or objects. I then apologies and told her that my facial expression always gives a bad impression, but then she nodded and said ""no, it's not because of that"". I know it's unprofessional but I started to cry after that because I couldn't hold it in anymore. 
Two Units for which I applied for, suggested that I should apply there. I've gotten feedback that my facial expression is scary, that I should work on my structure and organisation and that I shouldn't do things that I'm not allowed to do yet (I tend to try and do as many things as i can so that the other nurses like me) but I've also gotten feedback that when I talk to patients, I give a soothing impression with my voice and with how patient I am. I've been told that I look smart (described that I'm the Brain), and I always replied that in reality I'm not smart at all and that I struggle with remembering things. I know I have a lot of negative things going on with me but empathyless? I think that people are machines ? where did all that come from ? why do I give such a bad impression? 
I feel so terrible, I already know I'm the worst human ever but I do try my best to make people feel comfortable and welcomed. I never judge them on purpose so where did all that come from ? should I see a therapist just so someone can tell me.the truth about myself ? what should I do ?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years and I am finding it impossible to cope with losing my other cat.

She always comforted me when I was sad and was an overall sweetheart. It's like there's a void in my house where she used to be (if that makes sense)

how to cope after being made the asshole?,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, but here it goes! SO, basically!!!

Drowning in my own tears,"
I (F/22) am a reserved person and never really had a positive or functional family life. My dad died when I was 10 and my mom (youngest of her family) never really moved on from that and has always been dependent on other people. My childhood home was foreclosed and at age 18 I lived in a crusty trailer park with her for three years. Finally out now, but the deep emotional turmoil is still with me. It's been a long journey to accept and let go of grief and constant longing for a protective nurturing positive figure.

My current boyfriend of 2 years and 4 months has been there for me more often than I'd like to admit to get me out of that trailer park to finally start living on our own. And we're finally doing that and for that Im very grateful.

But it's been obvious that I am still emotionally dependent and needy. I've had over sixteen weeks of therapy and it's helped a lot but this is the hardest obstacle I've had to tackle with myself, trying to build resilience and harden myself like my partner has. We had a long talk tonight basically about what we'd change about each other. He said he feels like my parent sometimes and that he can only rely on himself and maybe 2 other people, sometimes. But not me because I'm not in a fully realized independent position yet. To be honest that struck me like an arrow.

I already told him if he feels like he has to act like a parent, I'd rather him not act at all. I don't want to be constantly coddled or  comforted, and I told him it's not fair to assume he can only rely on himself if he doesn't give me a chance to.

We ended this conversation on a good note that we both have to make changes and now he's hanging out with our friends/roommates but for the past 3 hours I'm still upset and crying in the room (I told him I needed space). 

Why is letting go so hard for me. Why is it when I feel this shitty and keep thinking about my dad that I have to be the most alone. It's been over 12 years but I feel like I cant move on like my mom hasn't and one of my biggest fears is ending up like her. 

I'm also doing way better at work than I used to and everyone depends on me in some way (Executive Assistant in a small business) but how can I make my partner see that I'm dependable?

How do I pick myself up by my bootstraps in all aspects of my life?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wife wants space to fight depression,"Sorry if wrong thread but I feel like maybe people have more first hand experience with something like this.

So a month ago, my wife moved out of our home after admitting that her depression has taken its toll on her and she gave me the old quote 'I love you, but I'm not in love with you'.  We have been married just shy of a year but have been together for 6 years prior to that.  

She was distraught when she dropped that bombshell on me and I felt my whole world crumble.  She is adamant that I havent done anything wrong and that I've done nothing but care, respect and been loyal to her and she feels ashamed to feel like this, and she just needs to have time and space for her self to figure out herself and if she got into a relationship with me for the right reasons (she was in 2 really toxic relationships previously and then started a relationship straight away with me, and she doesnt know if I was a crutch for her or if it was genuine).

For a while she has been unhappy with her job, the house we live in and our financial situation (finances are now pretty much resolved after making some sacrifices) and also with lockdown she has essentially been a prisoner in her own home for 3 weeks.

I have given her the perfect opportunity to tell me if she was having an affair. I told her that if she told me the honest truth, I will not react in anger or resentment, and I would just accept her decision and I would have to think things through for a while.  She again has been adamant there is nobody else involved. 

She has booked her self in for councelling with her depression and I think that starts pretty soon.

I feel in complete limbo land at the moment and I feel scared and alone and worried about what the future holds.  I have made contingency plans if things go south.  I speak to friends and family about this situation and the advice is poor at the best of times.   People keep telling me that I should give her an ultimatum and pressure her into coming back, which I know is completely wrong and it's something I should not do.  I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it.

Things have been fairly positive, we have met up at least once a week for walks/coming over for dinner etc etc.  But it's all very friendly, but I do say that I love her every now and then.  She wants to take things one step at a time and she is open to marriage counselling, if the mental health counselling doesnt work out.

I think deep down she still loves me even though she doesnt say it or that she misses me but does slip in the odd soppy nickname here and there. Might be just a habit, I dont know.  She still clearly cares about me because the other day she barged into the house after my phone wasn't receiving sending calls or texts and I didnt let her know I was safe at home. She also does other things like picks things off me like the odd scab and blackhead here and there, cut my hair and hugs me in a meaningful manner. 

I feel like I may be rambling a bit here, I want to feel positive about things but I am really struggling.  I am putting a brave face on for her so she has less pressure, but anytime we part ways I sob uncontrollably for hours because i just love her so much and want her to come home.

Has anyone else gone through something similar with their spouse? Any tips? I've been extremely self critical and I can see there are improvements I can make to make the relationship better.  Especially now we have more financial freedom.  But with lockdown still in force, it makes things 10x more difficult.

TL;DR 
My wife wants space to find out what she wants.  She says I've done nothing wrong.  We still talk and meet up.  Marriage counselling after her individual counselling.  I'm hurting and want neutral advice.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Therapy anxiety,"I don't know if this us the right place to ask this but here goes nothing.

I had therapy a few years ago, combined with medication, which ended up worsening my mental health and adding ""extreme anxiety with therapists/fear of even talking to them"" to the list because of previous shitty experiences with them (was wrongly diagnosed and treated). After two years of my condition getting worse and worse to the point of daily meltdowns, mood swings, and other problems (won't go into details because even writing this as anon on here makes me uncomfortable and anxious) I decided that enough is enough and I need to do something. 
We (me and my mother) were recommended a therapist, since I didn't want to go to someone with no recommendations and reviews.
I wanted to contact the therapist. Really wanted. But didn't, because every time I thought of it I was on the verge of tears and freak out for who knows what reason. Since it's been more than two months already, my mum gently asked if she could help (she's very understanding and trying her best to support me for the past few years). 
So, I asked her to contact the therapist asking about consulting ""daughter, age 20"" (me). To which the therapist answered that ""she's an adult and can contact me directly if she needs therapy"". My mum's reply about me having issues with communication and asking her to write were ghosted by therapist. 

So, my question is. Did I fuck up? I'm overanalyzing everything, I know, but was asking my mum to make the first move to contact the therapist the wrong thing to do? I don't know how to deal with this situation.

puberty? attention? depression?,"hello

i am a teen who is going through puberty right now

which is why i don't know if I'm even depressed or what, if i am, then am i just seeking attention? everytime i think to myself that i might have depression, it just hits me that this is just puberty, im just seeking attention and whatnot, i feel really unhappy, i started wanting to eat less, wary of my weight (i am very self-conscious) and I can't sleep without using my phone to sleep, i feel like im such a failure to my parents who are trying to raise me with their best, i always tried my best to be a good child to them, not doing what they didn't want, but i felt like i suddenly changed, i didn't want to be a good kid anymore, following all the rules and having to hide what's not good within me, i just wanted to be who i am without trying to hide it from them like it's such a crime, but I can't because im too afraid, i want to be honest with them and relieve this feeling off my chest but I can't, i always think they'll probably think that im just wanting attention, I don't want to be ashamed, i don't like the feeling of embarrassment, i just want to be alone, away from everything but i want to talk at the same time, it's just that i always rethink it, when i think of talking with someone, my mind just rethinks everything and i eventually end up not talking with someone, so i wanted to talk here, with more responsible people than me

I could also be probably just too self conscious, I don't know, im doubting myself with everything i think which could be the reason, making me not come up with an answer, I've also been feeling empty for a very long time, i could laugh and be happy at times but it doesn't feel right, like there's something missing, i don't have any traumas that i can remember to be a source, im an introvert who dislikes social interaction and is comfortable isolated, i have thanatophobia which I don't remember having a trauma of either but i suddenly get panic attacks as if im being choked and my brain just goes blank, which i haven't told my parents about either but i had a panic attack before in front of them which probably just seemed like i was just feeling unwell or something to them i think, i only remember it vaguely which is why i don't really remember what happened but I do remember them being passive about it (?), considering everything was completely normal and i don't remember them asking me why i acted like that, and right now as im typing, i feel like im making my parents look shitty even if they're not and i know they don't deserve it and im just rambling stupidly like this but i felt like i just had to open up everything i hadn't told them since i developed bottling up my feelings instead of talking

im probably better gone, but i don't want to leave my parents

am i depressed or just over reacting? or attention-seeking? or is it really puberty like i think so?

I don't know anymore, i just feel miserable

honestly I don't even think this needs a requesting advice flair and needs more of a rant flair, but I'll keep it there because it's the reason i actually came here

this is probably so confusing because i just went ahead and u typed whatever i was thinking so im sorry about that","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Therapist suggested medication - what to expect,"I have expressed to my therapist that no matter what I do - exercise, keep in shape, work hard - nobody will ever convince me that I am worth anything. nobody. I just see it - I am so fucking worthless and every day I have to make a mental list when i wake up about why is not the day I should kill myself (usually fear, or lack of a good method). I explained to her that every time I see my reflection in a window, a mirror, see my photo, etc. I am convinced I have to be removed from society for the good of it and that there has never, ever been a person that was born as worthless as me. That every situation I am ever in I consider myself the most worthless person in the room, and therefor there is no reason to keep living each day. I am all alone and nobody likes me, which is further reinforcement of the idea that I am worthless. After all, what is something that nobody wants? Trash. And what do you do with trash? Discard it.

I feel like medicine is giving up. I feel like it is just a mask for my problems. It doesn't MAKE me a person of worth that people will naturally gravitate to (my standard for being worthwhile). It would just distract me from the utter despair and sense of desperation that is part of being a person of no value. This is why I'm opposed to medication. It doesn't fix the problem. The only way I see out of this problem is to become a high-value person or to remove myself from the world.

I am not sure what to do. I've never taken any psychotropic medicine before. But I am running out of time to make myself a high-value person (I set a deadline of 3 months). This is because I'm 40 and alone and, even though I was married and in a LTR for 12 consecutive years, I've been alone for 1.5 years now and I consider it a massive personal failure. The inability to attract people is a massive personal failure and a sure-fire indication of my low worth. I guess I'm just asking does this medication actually work or would it simply be a method of deluding myself and blinding myself to the reality of my absolute low-value self?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Nothing is right in my life. I don't know if I can be fixed.,"I'm a 21 year old guy and I'd say I'm at the end of my rope but I'm too scared to do anything stupid. I've tried dealing with my depression by putting in place a sleep schedule, eating extremely clean, and exercising daily. It hasn't helped. 

I feel tortured by my existence. Its like this is one cruel dream I cant wake up from and the only thing I look forward to is going to sleep to escape from the unsolvable problems in my life and in my head. 

In the past 2 years my mom, grandma, and dog have died. I've gotten very sick multiple times and I feel like it gave me brain damage. I cant focus. I went from being a straight A college student to failing multiple classes. Organizing my thoughts is tedious and having the motivation to even think about assignments is a real struggle. I keep putting back on weight and then losing it and gaining it back because I fall into habits that I cant completely break. I live in a run down shack taking care of an elderly person and tiptoeing around my abusive father. I work 30-35 hours a week and still cant afford to be on my own. At work I make a mistake every 45 seconds because i cant focus on what needs to be done or analyze the situation. 

People get angry at me and tell me to just stop trying because I only make things worse. That gets to me the most because I just feel so worthless as it is and now everyone around me is confirming those negative thoughts that I fight so hard to tell myself are just my mind playing tricks. I'm literally exactly what I see myself as and the pain that brings make me feel like I'm being ripped apart from the inside. 

I cry myself to sleep, cry when I wake up, and cry in the middle of the day in my car. Theres nothing I can latch onto except for the dim hope that maybe one day I'll feel better and it's such a thin line to hold onto. 

I was both abused and neglected starting at about 5 years old. Prior to that I was raised very well, then my parents just took their anger out on me physically and verbally for years until eventually they just told me they gave up on me. I hated myself so much in highschool and would never let girls get close to me and even developed a violent hatred towards them. I became a drug addict, using opiates mixed with other drugs nearly every day to numb how I felt. No one ever caught me and I had to quit on my own. I dont think my brain ever recovered from this either. 

In the past 2 years I've stopped enjoying all hobbies. I barely will myself to practice guitar a couple times a week. I cant play video games at all and have maybe put 24 hours into them the last 2 years. I go running everyday because of the endorphins rush but it's so incredibly boring and then I remember I have to come back to reality and go to work and be put down by everyone around me. 

None of the goals I set a year ago excite me. In fact, I live in fear of accomplishing them because I just cant see myself enjoying them. But I changed my mind about what I wanted to do every year before that and I cant afford the time or money I will waste if I change my path yet again. And there is nothing I want to change it to anyways. I have to stick with something for once and the disinterest is killing me. 

I have physically insecurities that shouldnt bother me but do because I'm already in such a fragile mental state. I've never had a semblance of a relationship or been involved with anyone sexually and the loneliness doesn't help but reinforce my negative image of myself. I have bad genetics and pretty undesirable physical features, so even when I'm in good shape I'm not much to look at. 

I used to take pride in my intelligence but I dont have that anymore. My brain has been fried, neglected, and has deteriorated to the point where I may be able to understand complex ideas, but I'm slower to process than your average remedial student. This is why I suffer at work and in conversation, I have to try very hard just to understand what people are asking of me and sometimes they just sound like unintelligible chatter unless I focus very hard. It's like I'm underwater. I'm completely incapable of multitasking and it costs the store money because of things I continually mess up and forget about. The only thing I have is speed and I can make things look nice, that keeps me scheduled. But I've gotten lectured so many times about fuck ups. 

None of my opinions about the world are well received. I think that we need to get along by compromising and meeting eachother in the middle. People these days are to one extreme or the other. I feel even crazier not having anyone agree with, what to me, seems so intuitive. 

Nothing is right for me and I'm so tired of feeling this much pain. I can't see a path to making things better or I would move towards it. I'm not giving up I just don't have anymore options and I want somebody to just help give me some clarity. I've watched people like jordan peterson and alan watts to try two different paths of fulfillment and neither works to calm my mind. I'd appreciate any advice in how to feel better and maybe one day feel happiness again.

Depressed firefighter ends things,"My (30 f) ex boyfriend (34) ended things from depression at the beginning of the shut down from covid. He told me he didnt love me anymore almost 3 weeks ago.  I dont know if this is how he really feels or if it's the depression closing him off to feeling anything. I haven't spoken to him since he told me. But I go back and read older messages leading up to the break up and I see him telling me he's struggling with the depression but he tells me how happy I make him and how much he loves me and I keep him afloat. But once he hit a really bad rough patch he closed me out completely. Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lasted/or while you or they got help? I believe in my heart he does love me and the depression suppressed those feelings. You dont just have those feelings disappear from a happy relationship without some type of issue going on. I've been dying to reach out to him but I was the one that said I needed to heal, but with the riots going on and him being a firefighter and his mother telling me he said the therapist is getting him to open up I want to reach out so bad.

Up late and cant sleep,"
I posted in r/suicideprevention a while ago saying that I would either kill myself then or never and when I tested my weight on the noose by putting my foot in it it snapped hence me being alive

Somehow I thought that the decision to keep going would magically fix things and make me happy but I now feel worse

Nothing has gotten better I tried to make friends but turns out im still a very unlikeable person and all of the conversations I had stopped happening by the next day

I feel like I should stick by my decision but I dont want to

Is there anyone who has advice that could help any aspect of this. advice to motivate myself enough to make breakfast  advice on making friends or anything that would help

Am i a bitter person?,"Am I a bitter person?

Hi guys
Please can you try &amp; be as honest &amp; raw as possible, i really dont mind if comments are a bit brutal as feel like I need the truth telling! 

Okay, so i am incredibly insecure, 22 year old, i come from an incredibly broken home (parents messily divorced, narcisstic mother, abusive older sister). My mum never showed me any direct love or any care just left to my own devices all my life leaving me to learn lifes hardest lessons on my own. Hoenstly a majority of life for me has been constant negative events, everything i love becomes everything i loose-my friends-family-job- self respect, esteem- nothing ever goes right for me. All i know is sadness being let down being dumped feeling sad. All my life since the young age of like 7,8, Iv always dreamed of a boy loving me. I dont know why this love had to come from a boy directly, but all my life Iv craved it, dream of it fantasized soo many things in my head just depserate to be loved. Im 22, never had a boyfriend, every single guy i go for has rejectived  me because of how I look im not a size 8, (but a size 22 instead) and iv only ever known unrequited love. Im not at an age mentally &amp; physically and emotionally where im ready to settle down and crave  this life with a man who is going to look after me, and bring up a child in all the ways i want and give it what my parents failed to give me. All my friends are getting engaged, it kills me inside to know im not the type of girl anyone wants to marry.

For this reason, I cannot stand seeing other couples, and women happily in love. My cousin who i am very close to,  married the love of her life and they now have a boy, a girl. The perfect perfect family. On the recent birth of her daughter (about 3 weeks ago) The whole family was so ecstatic. But when  i heard, i ran into my room &amp; sobbed. I sobbed that why cant that be me. Shes got it all now, a son, and a daughter. And why cant I have that? Similarly i saw an INstagram couple recently who, gave birth do a daughter. Inside i burnt, i hate this couple and they dont deserve to be happy, iv had the hardest life and i have had nothing go right for me, why should these people get it ? 

Today i saw my cousin again after 6 weeks and I feel so angry when I look at her, and the baby. Because of my own life, iv always wanted to bring up a daughter. I know what i was missing in my life, and i guess its redemption from my bad childhood that id love to bring up my own daughter like my parents couldnt &amp; give them everything id wish i had. I dream of it all the time, its my biggest goal in life. Thats why when she had a daughter, i was wishing it was a boy so she wouldnt get her ‘perfect life’. If it was a boy i wouldnt be this resentful, this hatred, this angry. When i look at her &amp; the baby i feel angry, that WHY cant that be me? Why cant i have met my childhood sweetheart, why cant I have a lovely baby girl &amp; boy, why am i the type of girl nobody will marry? Everything she says about the baby i get offended, i take it as ‘shes showing off and rubbing it in’ and ‘shes got her perfect family now, shes smug’

Honestly i cant be happy for anyone. If i see an insta couple have a baby, i block. If i see baby girls especially being born my heart sinks inside. I even hate my own cousin now of jealousy, anger, i feel like WHY hasnt god let anyone love me, iv suffered so much in my life i deserve some love, not these guys who get everything handed to them on a plate. I want it, why should they? I deserve it for suffering my whole life and nothing ever going right.
I burn with jealousy when people have a good life-mostly with couples though, when i see people in love it kills me because im dying for that. I deserve it after the hell of a life iv had. Im so angry just looking at that baby &amp; my cousin.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
This is a cry for help...,"My story is a little bit long so I apologize for that.
I'm a step away from suicide. I've been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks.

Hi there. I'm a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that I'm an atheist and this is story isn't from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story.

I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smart-ass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings.

I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. 


One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know it's wrong. But it's part of the modern/religious culture that you live in.
For example you have to say ""I love you"" in the first month. Crazy, isn't it?
Also most relationships in iran don't include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. 
And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck.


So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please don't judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love.
She told me the same.
But after 2 months she told me that she can't get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. 

I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldn't love them and I still wanted that specific girl.

I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. 
How did that happen?

8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. 
A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. 
I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs (atheist) and her style and her face. She was kinda ""the one"". As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as ""Jane"". And, I refer to myself ""Jack"".

I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off.
I reached one of my girl-friends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20.
That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didn't care.

I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited.



But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her: ""did Jack say anything about me to you?""
She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that ""Jack is into Jane"".

She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too? 
I spent a week chatting with Jane on Instagram. She was absolutely amazing. 

So, sick of depression and everything, I took a leap of faith. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown. 
A few days later, I heard jane broke up with that asshole because of me. 
I started dating her and we dated for 2 months.

Finally, I was happy after a long time. I was living in heaven. She was so perfect that I was finally happy for a short time in my entire fucking life. I totally forgot about my ex girlfriend and fell in love with Jane.

Note: Jane is one month older than me.

I lost my virginity to her. We had sex for 3 times when we were dating. So I became kinda attached to her, you know?
I loved her and she loved me sooo much. We couldn't get enough of each other.
Something to add, she was extremely jealous. I thought that was really cute and adorable cause it shows that she cared for me but, our relationship got toxic.
She fought with me a few times about those 3 girls I dated in the past! I explained to her that they meant nothing to me and our fights ended with her saying ""I love you""

One night she told me she loved me so much. But if she sees that I'm flirting with other girls and stuff, she will breakup with me cause she can't tolerate that. I kissed her and told her that there is nothing she needs to worry about.

And I meant it.
I was 100% loyal and honest to her. 
But one time one of my friends (girl) from my ex-college  commented on one of my Instagram posts ""miss you"".
The next day, I realized Jane flirt flirted with a few guys. 
I asked her what the fuck was going on, and she said I started it.
I was heartbroken, told her that was a misunderstanding, and she apologized, which I accepted.
But, I was heartbroken cause I couldn't believe Jane wasn't loyal and committed to me.

One night, she told me that she's scared cause she feels like she is one of those girls who meant nothing to me. I told her she was insane and I'm in love with her.
 
Until one day when we were at one of my friends house and we were alone, I started making love to her. we didn't have much time so she got pissed off and told me that I was so selfish and I just wanted her for sex and left.

This led to our breakup. The next few days we fought and she started flirting with other guys.
I couldn't believe everything was falling apart. 

She told me that she loved me so much but she thinks that I don't love her so her love for me has faded away.
She told me that her personality makes her want to date older guys and I've been acting like a kid.

Break: can you believe age is this much important for girls in Iran? Well you can't blame them cause they have a lot of father issues,  but I really didn't expect it from Jane.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I was totally mature and loyal and honest about our relationship and the person who was acting like a kid was Jane the whole fucking time. But I got accused of ""acting like a kid"".

We broke up and she blocked me on everything. It's been 3 months since we broke up and it happened in the worst possible time.
I couldn't hangout with my friends to ease the pain cause of quarantine. I was lonely the whole time.

After quarantine was finished in Iran, I started hanging out with my friends and stuff but there is still a crushing pain deep down in my chest.

And you wanna know something funny? I heard she got back together with that asshole who treated her like shit.

Obviously knowing that she is this much immature made me realize I don't love her anymore. 
But I still miss that feeling. I miss being happy in a relationship. I miss being in love.

I've been seeing a therapist since we broke up and she helped me to ease the pain a lot but, I'm still extremely depressed. 

I can't study, I can't workout, my appetite is fucked up, my sleep schedule is fucked up, I can't enjoy anything. 

I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy being single. I want to put my career and studies above my dating life but I just fucking can't cause it seems like I'm still seeking for the love and attention that my parents never gave me.

Please help me.

"26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal.","Since i was a little boy I have always been shy. The problem is I never really grew out of it. I have always sheltered myself from doing normal things that probably would have helped me break out of my shell. Now i am 26 and I cant stop dwelling on all of the experiences and fun I have missed out on because of my depression and social anxiety that i had and still have. Even as a little kid I had this problem. For example almost every first day of school I had I cried and wanted to go home. Even at a few of my birthday parties i cried. My parents tried to get me to play football and i even was told i was going to be the quarterback but I stopped going before the season even started because I was afraid and embarrassed to say ""hike"" in front of my parents. Looking back I just wish i could be happy like everyone else. I also feel like I lived in the shadow of my 3 older siblings and a lot the energy and focus of my parents was on them, my oldest brother especially. One of the happiest times of my life was the 6th grade, I was in the cool ""clique"" at school. I had a lot of friends, one of them being a girl I had a crush on for a couple years before that and I had a lot of confidence and finally began slowly coming out of my shell. After that school year my parents sold our house and we moved to a different town. I knew my parents wanted to move for a while and honestly it was my biggest fear. This devestated me. I literally was in fetal position crying for at least 2 weeks after we moved into the new house. I went from a happy kid to a suicidal 12 year old within a short amoumt of time. Like i said always dealt with shyness and depression but I feel like this put me way back into a hole I could not get myself out of and has turned me into the man i am today. I spent the next 2 year's in middle school wanting to end my life. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink. I had freinds but I feel like they werent genuine freinds, just other people who enjoyed partying like i did. Most of the summers I spent alone sitting at home. It was like that in middle school too. I remember joking to a kid on the bus in middle school, telling him ""I go home and stare at my wall for hours then i go to school"". I never had a girlfriend in high school ( just a few hook ups). I regret not joining the track team (multiple people said i shouldve, I was really fast). I wish I had an intimate relationship in highschool. I was always pretty smart but I really just stopped caring about my grades at the start of freshman year. I had a lot of angst and spite against my parents and I attribute that to why I stopped giving a shit. Pretty much all i thought and cared about in high school was smoking weed. I shouldve been focused more on joining a club and my grades. Although marijuana was a huge escape that I initially loved I feel like it was one of the worst choices I made because it only made me more introverted. It also made okay with the fact that i was doing nothing with my life and not thinking about my future. I had one job as a bus boy which i quit after about 2 months. I graduated high school as a below average student wirh absolutely no clue what I wanted to do in college. I went to a community college for a month before dropping out. While there I felt extremely out of my element, only talked to fellow freinds from high school who also went there, and made zero new friends because of my social anxiety. After dropping out my life as an extreme recluse began. I worked but it was with my dad doing roofing and home improvement type work. I only hung out with one friend from high school and going to his house and getting drunk with his family at their house parties was the extent of my social life during this time. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed. This is how life was for about 8 years. Around 2013 i began taking lexapro and took it until Feb 2019 but it didn't really help. My oldest brother ended up overdosing form heroin 4 years after I graduated high school. I had a moment where i said to myself ""enough is enough, stop smoking, get your shit together and do something with your life"" but that was short lived. A year after that we moved to Florida. This move didn't really fuck me up as much as the first one but it did affect me a little as I do not like change in general. My drinking increased since I moved down here and I smoked just as much. Fast forward to November 2019. I turned 26 and holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a huge quarter life crisis and realized that the past decade of my life flew by so fast and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. I stopped smoking and stopped drinking after doing both habitually for at least a decade. I told myself I could not live like that anymore and if I didn't make a change sooner of later I would look back a decade from now and have the same regrets. I began considering joining the service but honestly had no clue what I wanted to do for a career and I still dont. I just felt like doing anything has to be better than doing nothing and it might help me out of my socially anxious depressed bubble that I am in. Unfortunately around mid November I began suffering from severe dry eye which i am still dealing with as i type this. It has cost me an insane amount of money in doctors visits and i still havent gotten better. I had lasik 4 years ago and it might be the cause (dont get lasik). This only has made me more depressed and suicidal. I also went to a cheap therapist for about a month during this time. I also went to a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for about a month and a half without any improvement and stopped because of fear that it would make my dry eye worse. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site. We talk for at least 3 hours over the phone everyday. This is the most social activity ive had in a long time (even though she does 70 percent of the talking. She likes talking about herself). Hearing her talk about her life only makes me more depressed because she has done so much and made the most out of her life. I honestly have no clue what she sees in me. I shared these feelings with her and to my surprise she is still talking to me, although she doesn't really understand how it feels to have depression and pretty much told me my life is not that bad. So here I am, a 26 year old socially inept man child who has no idea what he wants to do with his life. This dry eye problem is also stressing me out and i really want to get it taken care of so i can move on and do something productive with my life. I really think the military would be a good thing for,mw but I don't want to enlist until my eyes feel better but i also feel like time is running out because i can't join once I get past a certain age. I dwell on the past everyday and i wish I could go back in time. When I think about the past I get depressed and when I think about the future i get anxious. I get so anxious even thinking about being around New people because they will judge me and think i am too quiet. I also am afraid if someone asks about my past and my highschool/college life what do I tell them? I dont want to tell people I was a pothead who did nothing in Highschool. I also feel like im playing catch up in learning social skills when everyone else my age just has those skills naturally. I don't know what to do from here.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
"I give up, I want to die.","I am having suicidal fantasies and thinking of hurting myself. Anything to make this pain inside me stop. I think about ways I could go when I have downtime from work. This is a first for me. I've always taken my family's distain for me in stride but Im tired and I can't do it anymore. 

I'm tired of feeling rejected and unloved my family and so called friends. Several of my siblings have betrayed me and that hurts so much more. My bf is trans and they couldn't have reacted worse or said nastier things about us, upon finding out we were dating.
I can't make a friend that isn't in love with me and then leaves when they realize I really just wanted a friend. It's happened so often I just don't want to make friends anymore. I don't get it bc I'm so transparent about it. I feel so used and alone. My bf is great at making friends and I want to be happy for him but it hurts to see him make friends with real loyal people right off the bat.

I feel unwanted and unloved,"I’m 19yr girl. I’ve always had a rocky life. I’ve had an eating disorder since I was in 6th grade and,I’ve always thought that I was never enough.Then in 2017 I went through this long period of having severe health anxiety to the point where I would think my hand would stop working if I thought about it too much(Ik it’s weird)...lately it’s been my bf who’s made me feel like I wanna die.

Has anyone else struggled with post-graduation depression?,"After 6 grueling and mentally taxing years I finally graduated college a few weeks ago. While I am proud of myself, I don't feel as good as I thought I would. I didn't expect my depression/anxiety to be magically lifted, but I did expect it to get slighter better. Honestly, it's gotten much worse. After graduating with a degree I wasn't 100% sure of and an unfavorable internship in my area of study. I feel hopeless (I have a part-time job, but it's certainly not my career path and is unreliable due to the pandemic). I feel I have no career path and that I'll be stuck in this cycle forever. 

I don't know my direction in life and I don't even know how to find one. I can't picture myself happily in any career path. Even job searching online causes immense panic attacks. The though of interviewing for a 

My friends (most of whom graduated on time years before me) have already started their careers and I feel like I'm stuck in the mud...unable to lift my feet off the ground. It takes a lot for me to get out of bed and I feel my family is disappointed in me. I fear my friends think I'm lazy and unmotivated but I'd feel silly telling them how I feel at this moment. It's gotten to the point where I avoid dating (pre-pandemic, I have been following social distancing guidelines) because I feel like a failure when I tell people I don't know what I want to do. I even avoid talking to family members because I dread the career questions and I feel it's strained some of my relationships.

How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance?,"I feel so fucking hopeless, even though  I've been working out, trying to gain some healthy weight and muscle, naturally a quiet but nice person who genuinely cares what people think and how they feel. Been adding protein and healthier food options, and attempting to add more daily calories to my diet as to help me look less skinny and more healthier and fit. But at the same time it's honestly for nothing, I'm worthless and people make sure to remind me of that. I don't know how I was placed on this earth for basically every single person I've spoken to, to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit. I'm only 19 and I feel so fucking ugly, I've been told by the nicest prettiest girls that I, ""Look like an old man."" on multiple different occasions. Do you realize how fucking painful that is? Imagine if I told that same girl, ""You look like a 50 year old lady."" I fucking guarantee you she'd have been heartbroken from hearing that. How the fuck am I the only person in the world who thinks about how my words can possibly hurt someones feelings? Am I the only person who thinks before they speak? My own family has teased my appearance including high school teachers. I've heard friends of mine overhearing teachers making fun of me behind my back. My OWN friends make fun of my appearance straight in my face. It's impossible to have self confidence when you've literally been proven to be fucking hideous, people don't tease me to share a good laugh. They do it because I'm genuinely ugly and nobody cares about how depressed I am and how I have literally not a single person to talk to. I can't get suicide out of my head I don't wanna live with other humans if they're just gonna make me feel shunned and worthless. I really don't know what to do. I've tried to make myself the best person I can be but nobody gives me a crumb of appreciation. All my hard work literally doesn't mean anything to anyone and nobody cares. 

Sure I'm doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel  accepted by someone. I've never had a girlfriend, never had a best friend, never had someone I spiritually resonate with. I've never had anyone. I was physically abused by my father and I've been completely alone ever since. My entire existence has only been suffering and I don't understand why I'd be put here just to feel pain and suffering all while completely alone. I just bottle up all my emotions and pretend it doesn't bother me but of course it's eating away at my sanity. I don't have to be gorgeous or the prettiest man but I'm just tired of hearing how ugly I am. It breaks my heart so much I can literally feel pressure on my heart just thinking about how wrong I've been done over the course of my entire life. 

I guess the main reason I typed this all out is really to ask, how do I keep going even though I'm completely alone? How do I keep living knowing that I'm all I've ever had and nobody is there for me? How do I find the motivation to keep being a kind person when all I've been shown is repulsion for just trying to be myself. How can I find a friend or girlfriend that cares about my opinions and point of view on life without making me feel ugly and worthless. How do I find any reason not to end my life with the gun that's in the room right next to me?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Does anyone else feel like they deserve to feel depression and feel shitty all the time?,"I'm just curious if this is a normal feeling. I might have options to get out of my depression, like certain pills, maybe PMS pills (antidepressants seem to never work but my depression gets 10 times worse around my period) and maybe counseling would work. Maybe these things would work if I tried them again even if they haven't in the past, but for two reasons I haven't(besides cost). First I don't think they'd work or the side effects to meds wouldn't be worth it. But second and perhaps more important idk that I want to get better, I feel like I should live with all the shitty feelings and guilt, like I have to or deserve to. I don't do it for attention, maybe once in my life when I was much more lost, when all this depression started to get bad, but not anymore, I barely even talk about my depression to anyone anymore.

What would you do in my position?,"I’m a pretty young boy still trying to develop my character. I’m in high school. I like to think I’m more mature than other people my age. Before I go into why I’m so unsure about something, I’m just going to give you some background story if you care to read it. 

Background:
In elementary school I was verbally abused by racism and many other factors. I was always picked on for some unknown reason. I like to think I was a very optimistic kid. However, those years was a turning point into how I ended up. I took this bullying pretty hard. I lived in fear the following year. I didn’t tell anyone about how I felt. I remember crying almost daily. 2 years after the bullying crisis I started to feel like I healed. I thought I made true friends that year which end up being really bad. I was ignored by that person for who knows what. I started to hang out with girls more as friends. I felt they were more understanding. I think it affected how I act because I remember changing my personality 3 times. People started to tell me that I act like a girl. Even my own parents. So I changed myself again. I became more and more less optimistic. I became more dry and alone. That following year, those friends I made (who were the girls) was a mess. I was a mess. I was so much in pain I did so many stupid things. I don’t even want to talk about those moments. I felt targeted by that friend and victimized. I was in fear that year too. At that moment I accepted that it was better for me to not have friends or anyone to care for me. I made this conclusion because my parents weren’t all that understanding either. I tried telling them how I feel multiple times, but they give me the answer that hurts even more. “There are people having it worse than you” (which I agree. But I don’t think that’s the main issue. I think the part they should see is how their issue effects that person). “You’re crying over a girl”(I’m relating to that one year I was victimized). It didn’t help that my brother is also illogical and not as mature as me. He’s younger than me but I was more matured than he was when I was his age. But everybody is different. That’s was me trying to say everything in short terms. And here I am present day. 


Quarantine made me feel more alone than anything. I thought I was used to dealing things on my own. These experiences that I’ve faced really made me think that there’s no one that understands me. I do these small things that no one does and I have a valid reason for why I chose to do it, but no one understands what I’m saying. I feel extremely excluded. Even to my own sexuality. Everyday I feel different. I feel so unnatural. I’m thinking it’s because I became unsure of who I am as a person because I changed myself so much. To make others more satisfied with me. I wanted to not be lonely. But changing myself made it worse. Death threats were made, insults about my physical appearance were made everyday, and I had no one to talk about it to. I envisioned my life being so happy 1 night. I had a friend who was caring and really nice. He was a true friend. I think what I’m trying to say here is that I feel so unloved and excluded. I feel that no one cared about how I felt. I had no one to talk to my feelings to so I became more irritated over little things. And no one in my life bothered to understand why. They thought I had low-temper. Which is not true. It’s really hard to explain all of these mix emotions I have in me. I remember my mom told me that I rely on others and not my parents. I could never tell them that I tried many times before that which came to no avail. I’m not diagnosed either. I always lie on those doctor depression paper thing because my dad watches me fill those out which raises my anxiety levels. 


Also a side note: 
I’m a person who is fearful. I tend to not believe what happened and become regretful of many things. It’s a major flaw that I try to get rid of. It’s really hard to explain. I tend to be so caught up in the past that I can’t accept what’s in front of me. I can’t interpret what’s happening in that moment. 

What would you do if you were me? I don’t want my parents involved because they won’t understand me at all. I don’t want to tell my brother because he’s so illogical and I think he hates me for whatever reason. I have no friends to talk to that would understand me.

What can I do to have a normal life?,"My neglectful narcissistic dad has ruined my life.

Right now my confidence is lower than ever. I'm too self conscious to even go out to the kitchen. I'm extremely embarrassed of my body if my blanket is not covering it. I haven't talked to anyone besides my parents in over a year (except for the time when I had to go to my high school for exams 6 months ago. I dropped out shortly after). 

I suppress my emotions as much as I can, even when no one is around. When we're visiting relatives I pretend to be the perfect little girl, who smiles all the time and loves to study, has big plans for the future, etc.

I'm worried that if things don't change, I'll just end it all (I'm not suicidal, so maybe in 5-6 years?). As of now, I'm not a functional human being and I have no use for anyone. I spend the whole day scrolling through reddit, watching videos on youtube and playing minecraft.

I want to get a job to get out of here asap, but I can't even look into someone else's eyes without getting a panic attack. I can't keep a conversation going even through texting. 

Therapy is not an option. The last 3 therapists have ruined my confidence and self esteem even more.

I want friends, I want someone to talk to me, I want someone to care about me and I want someone to care about, I want a boyfriend, I want to worry about things people my age worry about, I want to finally live the life I want to.

I kill myself if you don’t read,"My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven.Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe.

Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so I’m actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look; desperate; maybe a bit crazy. 

And it’s not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. 
I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice (ie family, childhood friends) I’m in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasn’t for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. That’s the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. It’s truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this.

Am I to blame for my boyfriends depression?,"Me and my boyfriend have a really good relationship most of the time.

Tips for staying in touch with friends?,"I find that when I start slipping into depression and loneliness and I'd like to reach out to people, my mind shuts down.  I can't even remember who my friends are.   

 This is especially true when there's something I'd like to do, and I'd like to do it with other people.  I simply can't think of someone who might want to join me.  It's a big blank - which makes me more depressed and lonely.    

Anyone have any tips or techniques that work for keeping friends and acquaintances in the forefront?  I was thinking of some nifty spreadsheet but that also sounds horrible.

Trying to help my bf with his depression after failed attempts.,"I'm an enlisted soilder. My boyfriend is a vet. He has not held a job for more than a few weeks. I've applied for jobs for him, gotten him 2 jobs, paid for his motorcycle repair, notarized his divorce paperwork etc. The list goes on and on. We've been together for a 1.5 years. Lived together for 1. He doesn't tell me he loves me anymore, doesn't call me anything other than ""hey"" or my first name, can't make plans more than a week in advance. His mother, our mutual friend and I have been taking care of him. He doesn't go out with friends or try to go back school. Nor does his physical therapy even though it's free.

He's actively not trying to do anything other than exist. Is it okay to just walk away at this point? As a soilder, I'm conflicted and feel like I can't leave a fallen soldier. As gf I'm exhausted and angry.

Advice for long-term positivity/productivity?,"Whenever I'm in a rut, I'll finally pull myself together, become motivated, and have like four productive days before I find myself in another rut.

I have been sexually assaulted(I think that that’s the proper term without get into detail) by my classmates when I was in sixth grade. I have been so ashamed that I didn’t tell anyone about this to this day. And I am still not able to work up enough courage to tell anyone my story.

How to start healing,"Hello all, 

I may not use the right language for this so forgive me if I get it wrong, it’s my first time posting and also the first time I’m trying to talk about what I’m feeling. I have been in a downward spiral for years and constantly in self destruct. I have victimised most people I care about and pushed everyone away and never let anyone get remotely close to me. This results in no one ever really “knowing” me and them thinking I am cold. The truth is I just don’t know how to put it into words. 
Lately I have wanted to try and improve on this... I want to start enjoying life again, I want to feel good about myself, I want to stop sabotaging positive experiences in my life just so I can feel that comfortable feeling that I am so used to: misery. 
I don’t want to suck the joy out of life anymore... I’ve spent the best part of 11 years constantly depressed and it’s so exhausting. I want to start helping myself  heal and become more connected with my own identity but I have no idea where to start. I’ve had countless therapy and am on strong medication for depression. What I’m asking is - how can I stop feeling like a victim in my own life and be stronger? What positives attitudes can I adopt or healthy habits can I develop to finally start the road to recovery and hopefully start to enjoy life again?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
What can be done to help my friend?,"I'm friends with a Finnish woman. We don't live in the same country.

According to her, her depression stems from being bullied back in school and being unhappy about her weight. 

She hates herself intensely and has a hard time trusting anyone. 

Sometimes I encourage her to do things that could improve her life, like working out or looking for a job, but she tells me that it is impossible to feel motivated to do it due to depression.

She's also made many attempts to kill herself.  Every few weeks, she gets into a suicidal state again.

And the part that makes it the hardest to help her is that, she has tried therapy many times and it didn't work. Then I suggested looking for treatment in neighboring countries, but she says it's pointless because it is the same everywhere.

I don't know what else I can encourage her to do.

I want to be happy again.,"  

Goal: Currently I am all timer sad and want to be happy. 

I am neither a good person nor a bad person. I am somewhere in the middle or maybe totally out of circle. I don't know. 

I feel like I am living three lives. One which I show to my Family, one to friends and ex-colleagues. I am jobless. And one my true self which I show to myself only. Of course any differences in personality from my true self I manage by pretending someone else in my other two lives. But as soon as I enter my room and after carefully slowly locking my door I throw away the mask I was wearing and then I can clearly see the differences in my voice, thoughts, body language and goals, if any. My body feels so relieved. Then I start getting back in my true zone where I forget the tasks and goals I had planned in my mind. And I start feeding myself the worthless shit on Internet. At that time, I am only looking for that temporary dopamine hits because nothing simpler was giving me any joy. I started losing myself in weed. I sometimes was stealing weed from my friends or roommates. After smoking for at least 3 years, a small joint was not that powerful anymore to bring down the curtains covering my real life problems. So, I jumped to eating. Now again, simpler food was not any joy. Junk is pretty much gonna hit the D-spot. Small meals mean less dopamine. Give me more and more. Don't worry, I'll puke the previous and eat again until I am so wasted by the effort of eating - throwing - eating- throwing and of course the taste of food. There are consequences too. Bloating, Gas, Always upset. But nothing can stop me from doing it again and again atleast from last 2 years nothing has stopped me. Then in search for more dopamine I look for porn. Again, simple means no joy. Fell into Hetero-BBC - Trans - Sissy. Now I don't imagine me having sex with girl instead I am that girl and big funk is fucking me. I started dreaming about dicks. Bought a vibrating dildo. But deep inside I still have that longing for intimate relationships with girl. I never had any. 

I am king of overthinking. I think of every consequence of my actions. Like where I keep dishes in kitchen. Opening and closing door. Even when I am walking down the road. Striking a lighter to light my joint. everything small you can imagine. This makes me mad and too conscious. I keep thinking of my childhood scenes where I lived with my parents and always wondering how time has passed. I was a kid back then and now I am an adult. I am so obsessed with age of people. How old is he or she? That actor? That sports person? and then I compare what I was doing when I was 16, 18, 23 etc. I am 26 right now.   
 I don't check my actions usually but when I check them, they are bad. I am using same pair of clothes for months. Using same toothbrush for years. I have rarely gave any gifts to any one. I am not so close with my parents. I am single child. I lived in rented place for 11 years before leaving for another city for college. My parents finally have their own house now. We live with parents in India till death.   
 I used to steal erasers, scales etc. from school. Even from my parents too. I have been caught sometimes. I now realized that maybe I was less satisfied with myself. I always felt less because all my relatives and friends had there own houses and car. My parents had one two-wheeler and my parents used to fight with each other which used to make me very sad. When I used to watch other parents living happily, I used to think why I don't have that, why my parents are always fighting? This less feeling I still have with me. I still feel less.   
 I am lazy for sure. Now I am sitting idle from last 1 year. No job, no friends, no personal connection with any human being. I never tell my secrets to anyone. Living in a rented room. Financially fucked, Relationships fucked.   
 I feel like a failure. I failed to become a good son, friend, brother, grandson or colleague.   
 I have become more secretive from last 2 years. I eat secretly, want to live secretly (deleting my pictures from social media).   
 I sometimes think If my parents die then I would have no one to answer and then I can live this miserable life for long. I don't think about my future at all. I have not reached the suicide point yet but I think this is how you reach there eventually. I can't imagine myself having a simple life with family and kids and work. I get very anxious imagining that will I be able to do that for these many years. I blame myself for all this. I did not take action when it was needed.   


In the end, I just want to be happy. ","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
Weekly depression.,"Hey guys, I’m new here. I’m a 21 year old guy and I grew up in a pretty rough household. I had struggled with daily suicidal depression from the time of 12-18. When I was 18 it got a little better and I went 8-9 months without having a though about suicide! (During that time I had periods of feeling sad or down, but honestly not depressed?) and it’s been periodical up until this last fall. I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a couple of months and just recently I started realizing it becomes more prevalent toward the end of the week/weekend? Have you guys ever heard of something like that? I’ll smile, and laugh and hangout with others, but  in my thoughts I’ll just be thinking about suicide? I hate feeling like that, as it becomes more prevalent I find myself getting less and less motivated as I’ll gain weight and even lash out on people I love.

I honestly dont know what im doing here....i guess i just want my story hear even though its rather insignificant and dumb haha. But i feel different now this is a different kinda of depression, i feel more just empty rather than hating myself or wanting to hurt myself. I dont really know how to cope with it. Like is this just how you feel after a break up and it passes or like do i just feel empty now...? 
Yes he was my first in practically everyhing we did over all but i cant help to feel it was all fake... he said he would think abouy her when we were together thats when i knew his depression was bad because he would just stop everything, caring, talking to me, all attention would stop it like would mental fuck me up. Like when he would do that it was a never endint cycle in my head like ""okay what wrong how do i help or just support,what if its me? Can i be nicer? Can i be sexier? And i ugly yo look at? Is he thinking of her? Etc."" And it would every single time come down to him just randomly missing her. Like even right now it still fucks me up when did he think of her? When i was my happiest? Like it just all crumbles in to lies for me. 
Or im over thinking this whole thing and should stop thinging of it but its hard lol. I dont know maybe im in the wrong post but just advice, help on my depression how to cope with my body image cause i think im gross.i really dont know","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Please help,"  Hi sorry this might be kind of confusing as I honestly just had a panic attack but I’m staying with a best friend at her lake house and I’ve been feeling really bad since she’s been pretty much ignoring me. Even if she doesn’t realize it. She’s also been openly Fighting With her step dad whose with us and it’s making me feel really sad and super uncomfortable. It’s not like I can just leave and if I could I would. I’ve also tried telling her how I’m feeling through text but it didn’t really work out and she thought we were over if after an hour but it’s more than what she thinks and it’s super hard for me to say anything since my anxiety is so bad at the moment.  I’ve cried 3 times today and just feel like complete shit. And I feel like I don’t exist and at this point I really don’t want to.

   I get that she has issues to deal with but I am her guest and idk I didn’t think I’d have to worry about this. She’s also been texting ppl and usually I don’t mind but It started to make me uncomfortable yesterday when she would start sexting with random guys who she knew she’s just block later.  Like I really don’t wanna hear about that I wanna have fun. Also once she found out I was upset (like 10 mins ago) she didn’t even wanna help she just got mad when I couldn’t say anything and stared having a panic attack.  Then she stormed off saying she was gonna kill herself which really triggered me.

How does therapy start?,"Hello fellow redditors!

I have been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. I have often theorized if therapy could help but actually going there was always out of question (for a variety of reasons). 

I have read what therapy is supposed to give you (no cure, but a more endurable existence?) but never how one goes about the whole thing. How do you choose a therapist? Do you just walk in and just start talking about all the bad things? 

I have never confided in anyone so it just seems more than obscure to just walk in and tell a stranger that I want to kill myself because there is no purpose to it all anyways...

How to talk to me GP about my depression,"I have had progressively worsening depression since adter an abortion I had in May 2018.

It started out as episodes of sobbing crying a lot and then I started having episodes of obsessive/instrusive thoughts in December 2018.
I started having thoughts of suicide this year. They started as instrusive thoughts and now they bring comfort.

I live in a small town, surrounded by other small towns and there aren't many options when it comes to mental health. 
I do have a GP that I really like and trust and my insurance pays for 1 check up a year and that is this Thursday. I want to talk to her about my depression and what I should do. I don't know how to bring it up, I don't talk out loud about myself often at all. I want to just crawl into bed and stay there forever but I know I can't just live my life like this.

Looking For Coping Methods,"My depression has been really declining lately. I live in a really bad household and I'm being targeted by my grandfather- whom nobody will stand up to and if I try to stand up for myself, I'm the one in the wrong. He's been yelling at me over small things, calling me all sorts of names, leaving stuff at my door for me to trip over, and more.   


This especially hurts because him and I used to be friends- when my mother was the one being horrible and nasty (She calls me disgusting, a few slurs, etc) he was the one that was always there to comfort me and try and talk it out with her. Now, however, it feels like that never happened. It feels like I was the one who did something wrong, and I don't know what.   


It's seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend, friends, and myself. It's an incredible struggle to eat just a meal a day, my lips are getting torn because I pick at them, I can't ever get to sleep and stay asleep, it's frustrating and since I'm a teenager I can't leave this enviroment.  


What do I do to cope? I use music to try and melt away, I play games like animal crossing to stay distracted, I draw, I play ukulele, I just breathe and try to remember that it will pass. I'm terrified of being suicidal, I've attempted once and was lucky- I know I'm capable even if I don't want to and that scares me.  


What are some methods you guys use to deal with these sort of things?

I'm literally living in a mess,"I'm not sure if this is exactly the right sub for this but I'm pretty sure I can't be the only person in this position and I cant handle too much judgement about it because I an already beating myself up so much for being disgusting. 

This pandemic has hit me hard. I live by myself, I lost my job and my relationship. I am a mess. My family all live very far away. I am falling to pieces and every night when I pass out crying I pray I wont ever wake up.

However with everything that's happened and the dip in my mental health it is now disgusting. I havent cleaned in months. I haven't done laundry. I havent showered or put sheets on my bed.

Everybody seems to be “adulting” so well. I feel like I’m the only one who can’t cope.,"Hey everyone, I would like to apologize in advance for the long post. And, thank you for taking the time to read my post. 

My high school experience wasn’t so amazing. I was depressed about 60% of the time. Nevertheless, I was a decent student. I tried many things. I was in the choir club, swimming club, netball club and music band. I didn’t particularly feel passionate about my extracurricular activities but I was interested enough to keep pursuing them. Same with my subjects, I did my best and tried to achieve good grades. I was good at art and languages. Once again, I was not passionate about them. In fact, I hated art because I felt the heavy work load sucked the fun out of the subject. Math and science were my weakest subjects. I tried so hard to excel at them but in the end I couldn’t cope. I was emotionally drained, burned out and gave up. My final grade for these two wasn’t so amazing, as expected. Nevertheless, I passed.

When I left high school I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I was expected to go to college, but I had no idea what I wanted to study. My mom expected me to either become a doctor, accountant or lawyer but, as my math and science grades suggested, that was never gonna happen. In the end I decided to abandon the norm and “follow my passion”. My “passion”, being fashion design, was my worst nightmare in college. I regret not listening to my gut and leaving. But I was too caught up in not wanting to disappoint my parents and, I had no clue what I would have done had I left. So, I stayed. And there began the downward spiral. I spent the next two years of my degree, confused and depressed. I couldn’t cope in my final year and at one point, tried to commit suicide (no one knows about this incident). In the end I failed a module only to repeat and pass it the following year. Because I do not talk to my parents about how I feel, they still think I want to be this “amazing” fashion designer.

Since then, I have been battling on and off with these intense feelings of sadness and worthlessness. *Everybody seems to be “adulting” so well. I feel like I’m the only one who can’t cope.* I don’t know what I want in my life. I have no passion for anything. No values, ideals, goals-nothing. 

When I try to find something that I might be interested it, it starts off well but I am eventually overwhelmed by crippling fear and anxiety. I am at a point where I feel like I don’t deserve to be good enough. I cry a lot. I feel like a failure. I feel like I have failed my parents’ expectations of me. I feel like I have failed everyone around me, I feel like I have failed myself. 

The only expectations I’ve ever had for myself were to at least meet the expectations of the people who literally sacrificed their time and money to raise me. They didn’t have to (I’m kind of adopted), but they did. But even that I can’t do. I just wanted so much to be someone who has made their parents proud. 

I have now moved away from home and work as an English teacher abroad. I really needed a break from everyone’s expectations. And I thought that moving halfway across the world would help me with that. But clearly, it has not. Because have to deal with everyone’s expectations of me here as well. And I am not coping well.

I always tell myself to be tough, suck it up. I always make it seem as if I’m okay. I thought that I could do anything I set my mind to, that I could be good at anything so long as I try. But I can’t.  And for that, I feel less than.

I feel like I don’t deserve anything. Simple things like “I don’t deserve to wear make- up because then I’d look good, and I don’t deserve to look good.”  “I don’t deserve to have my hair done and have it look pretty, because then I’d get compliments. Compliments I don’t deserve from people who I have failed”. “I don’t deserve to have my opinions heard. I don’t deserve to have an opinion.  Because who do I think I am?!” 

I don’t have close friends because I feel like I might get caught out and exposed for the real me- a failure. I can’t even look at myself anymore. The guilt is too overwhelming. I wouldn’t even dare tell anyone I know how I feel. Because then **they’d know**. They’d be disappointed. I’d be a disappointment… I am a disappointment.  

There is a lot more where this came from. A lot of feelings and experiences that I either didn't know how to express well or didn't think of at the time. But, I tried my very best to convey all that I am currently feeling at the moment.

Thank you again for taking the time to read my post. It is much appreciated.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

I cannot function as an adult,"Im 24(f) and I cannot function as an adult. 
I can go to work. I can make money, but my executive function is so bad, I can't bring myself to pay bills, my friend has to remind me to eat, I forget to shower, I forget to do normal life things. I just got laid off. I can't do anything but watch YouTube videos. I can't keep dates straight. I constantly forget about doctors appointments. I've tried everything short of getting a personal assistant. 

I don't understand many social situations. Dating and making good friends is increasingly more difficult. I'll trust literally anyone. 

When I was younger my mother thought I might be on the spectrum but the doctor wouldn't test me because I was very social.

Do I have depression or am I overthinking?,"I've been thinking about if I have some type of depression for a while but put off asking people about it because i don't want to seam like the person who feels sad and all of a sudden thinks they're depressed. However I think its about time I ask. Every couple of days I'll have moments that can last 30 minutes to an hour or longer where I'm not happy, not necessarily sad... just unhappy?  even if the main feeling unhappy isn't happening if my friends ask me to go out with them after school I think about going along and then think that I wont have fun and start to dread the idea. This even happens with my girlfriend who I love but if she asks me if i want to come over the next day I will never say a definite answer, instead I'll say maybe or possibly just because I don't know how I'll feel like the next day. I also feel that nothing will bring me joy like video games, i will quickly get bored of them in these moments and try to think of something to do but everything I think of doing doesn't seem as if it would make me any less bored. In the mornings I'll think of the day ahead and absolutely dead it sop much that the night before I prep myself by saying why the next day is going to be good, this sometimes helps a bit but i usually run out of energy. I feel like i have a fair amount of symptoms of a less severe depression but from everything I've read it seems that an ""episode"" lasts around at least a week. I'm sorry if this is me just overreacting and/or that this is rude about me even thinking i might have depression and that i know nothing what others go through... but I don't know and that's why I'm asking.

I have a really hard time translating my thoughts/feelings (in generaI, literally about anything) into words. I just give up on being social sometimes because if I try all I do is stutter. It makes me feel like no one takes me seriously and sees me as intelligent. Because of this I’m scared to help, say my opinion, or engage in insightful conversations. I don’t feel useful. Though why I do I feel all of this if my life from an outer perspective is more than fine, and privileged. I have a supporting SO, and friends. But, I can’t seem to trust them, too. They haven’t given me a reason not to, so I don’t why I keep treating them as if they’re going to hurt me like the people in my life before.

How do I support my girlfriend who is struggling with depression?,"Hi, first time poster here, *I hope this is an appropriate post for this board.*

My girlfriend is struggling with depression, probably stemming from childhood trauma (unstable family situation, regular police presence in the house). She is taking large doses of venlafaxine (225mg for 120lb body weight) to cope with her illness, but it can only do so much.  **She often has problems controlling her anger**, which is related to the point of this post, because when she is in a depressed mood, anger is often the only way she can really communicate.

She **recently had a complete nervous breakdown** in the car (I was driving), over an argument we had. It **ended with her** calling an ambulance on herself to be **taken to emergency psychiatric care.** She is now considering some time in a psychiatric institution for herself.

Now here comes my main questions: She often has these breakdowns, where she often can only shout and scream, or completely retreat. She describes it as such: ""She can either scream, or say nothing and retreat to sleep for a day"". **I have found that I am very unhelpful for her in these moments.** I am a very careful person, and I think a lot before doing anything. She says she needs guidance and structure in these moments. ***How can I support her in those moments?*** **I have tried to give her clear instructions in those moments in the past, but it has not worked well.** I think my personality type just does not make it very credible if I say ""Calm down, we're doing X now"", because I dont behave like that in a non-crisis situation.

I think her anger is often a frustration about her inability to deal with her illness. Unfortunately, her behavior in those moments also scares me. So I am even more timid to help her. Not that I am scared that she will hurt me or anything, but I am scared of making it worse. Also, I quickly become frustrated if i try something and it does not work, which is an issue I need to work on.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: How do I support my depressed girlfriend during a mental breakdown? Anyone out there who can relate to her behavior and knows what works for them?

Someone please help.,"My life is a mess at 29. I’ve worked hard and accomplished some what success at uni etc. I’ve always been in a relationship but they’ve all ended. I started dating someone 4 years ago and lately due to messed up work schedules and far distances from where we live we’ve gotten distant and she broke up with me. She confessed to kissing her work colleague who is her best friend at work. Last week. Then she said she’d try to make it work, that she chooses us, she loves me, she doesn’t know how to live without me etc. yesterday she said she needs to be alone and she don’t think she can do it am tomorrow. She feels withdrawn from our relationship and she isn’t physically attracted to me anymore and still has feelings for her friend.

This girl has been the sweetest person ever. She’s truly a kind soul. We’ve treated each other really well through the usual ups and downs. 

I feel like I’ve lost everything. I’m sad for what we could’ve been. I’m lost and feel empty and my whole world is collapsing. Since she broke the news to me last week about the kiss I’ve been extremely depressed and sad and just can’t wait to go to sleep but that is useless cuz I get up thinking about her.

"Feel as if I'm toxic because of my depression and anxiety, but I dont want to be","As the title says, I feel as if I'm toxic to those I'm close to. When I ask they swear I'm not, but part of me feels as if they're saying that to be nice and not to hurt me. They let me rant/talk to them about things I deal with and how I feel, but I feel as if I'm making them feel bad also and becoming more of a burden than a friend. I feel as if I've ruined what could've ruined any future with 2 different people because of it.

I believe I understand and know the source of my depression and anxiety, and partly has to do with my family's religious beliefs. Yes I'm a Christian, but my beliefs are different froms theirs and if they knew, it would be a huge mess and them possibly kicking me out. My parents currently help pay for my college, but I'm hoping in the next year or so I can get a part-time job or internship to make enough to move out.

Anyways, the only access to help I have is counseling at school. I want to be better and be happy and ""normall"", but I dont know how and my parents beliefs (mostly their church) restrict me from doing so. I feel as if I'm stuck and in a constant loop of finally being happy, something happening or realize what I'm wanting to so is against what they believe, my anxiety getting bad, and then depressed. I have a close friend that tries to help me, but I feel as if he doesn't think I'm trying to get better. He understands the situation I'm in, but I still cant help but think that. I also got diagnosed with endometriosis which then restricts a lot of physical things I can do, which makes things worse mentally for me.

I've been asked by another friend if I have a hobby or something to keep me distracted, but I dont. I never did much activity growing up (due to religious beliefs) like sports or anything else. Even when I did find something I liked to do, I was told I couldn't anymore and had to give it up.

I just feel as if I'm stuck and I just dont know what to do anymore. I've been hesitant for a long time now to post here, but I'm out of ideas and ways to get better. If I need to say more to explain myself better I can, but I'd feel more comfortable being DM instead of me posting more here.

Does Anyone Else Feel Inferior to Those Around Them?,"It's like everyone around me has accomplished something amazing and life-changing, and all I've ever done was self-harm and cry.

I also feel as if every day I'm losing a piece of myself and it's causing me drastic emotional instability, I'm going to snap one day if I don't get help whether I like it or not. This is the only place I can vent without annoying my loved ones. All of my friends are sick of me, it's gotten to the point where even my depressed friend thinks I'm too much and no longer wants to talk to me. 

I can barely control any of my emotions anymore, it's like I'm watching my life instead of living it.

No matter what I think I feel like I can't stop myself from suicide,"I've spent so much time thinking about killing myself, even had dreams where I have put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. Just every time I'm thinking I drift towards thoughts of suicide. I just don't see the purpose in anything at all. Every time I try to think myself out of it I just fall back into thoughts of suicide again. Like the finishing thought behind all my thoughts is suicide and nothing else matters.

I just feel like unless I kill myself I'll just be here waiting to kill myself until I finally do it. At this point I'm not even sad anymore, I'm just THAT tired of being alive. I have nothing to gain from continuing to live, I'd rather just be at eternal peace after death over each day being wasted time after time after time again. I don't know what to do. Love is the only thing that I could imagine that could pull me away from these thoughts but then there's nobody who loves me, or understands me or wants to spend each day together.

"My life is amazing, but I'm a miserable asshole. I'm not sure what to do.","So I've hit a wall, and I don't really have any support in my life, so I decided to turn to you guys. Kinda weird for this to be my first post, but whatever.

And sorry in advance, this is probably going to be a long rant.

Like the title says, I live a really great life. I'm married to a beautiful woman who loves me more than anything, the sex is amazing, and she's smart and talented and has a great, lucrative job. I just graduated college (12 years later than I had planned, but doesn't matter) in a field that I'm really passionate about, with plans to apply for grad school. Financially, I don't live in luxury, but I'm comfortable. I have an amazing dog. I have a good, supportive family. I live in a safe neighborhood.

I'm not trying to brag, but just trying to illustrate how from the outside, I really don't have anything to complain about. I'm aware of how incredibly lucky I am. But the problem is, I'm just miserable all the time, no matter what I do.

For a little background, I've been in therapy for over two decades (I'm currently 34). For most of that, I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression, bipolar disorder, several anxiety disorders, and given cocktail after cocktail. Two years ago, it turns out it was a misdiagnosis and it was atypical ADD (no hyperactivity, just the concentration and motivation issues), and I've been properly medicated since. I've had ECT (electroshock) twice, before the ADD diagnosis. My current therapist is excellent, and tells me that compared to how I was when I first started seeing her (almost 9 years ago) I'm so far beyond where I was that it's astounding. I guess what I'm saying is, I've been lucky in that I've been able to take advantage of mental health resources, and what I'm experiencing isn't due to a lack of those.

I have been in quite a few abusive relationships (romantic and platonic) so I know there's some trauma I'm still working through.

But the problem is that despite all the progress I've made and all the wonderful things in my life, I can't feel any of that wonderfulness. I see my wife, I know I love her, I can act on that love, but I can't... feel it. It's just numb. I watch a show that makes me happy, and I just can't... feel that happiness. It's like I'm constantly, permanently disconnected from anything positive, and no matter how healthy my habits might become or what attitudes I choose to adopt, neutral is the best I feel about anything.

On top of that, it's like I've forgotten how to have fun. I have hobbies that I never pursue. I'll buy something, say a video game, and never play it. I have a pile of books I've bought but never read, and sadly, it's not because I'm just too slow at getting through them. It's like, when I try to do something that isn't work, I get these voices (not literal) in my head screaming ""you shouldn't be doing this."" The more I try to have fun, the worse I feel about it.

I mentioned I just graduated college - three years at a community college (could've been 1 1/2, thanks shitty counselling department!) and 2 years at UCSD. I graduated - though there wasn't a ceremony or anything (thanks Covid) - and felt... nothing. I didn't feel pride, or relief, or anything. It was like I'd just finished washing the dishes - ""okay, that's done, what's next?""

A couple of years back, I got my black belt in a very difficult martial art after 7 years of training three times a week. The test was a four-hour ordeal that literally involved, at one point, blood streaming down my face as I fought a marine twice my size (they paused it for a few minutes so I could clean myself up). When they announced the results a few days later, I didn't feel pride, or accomplishment. I just felt imposter syndrome: I didn't deserve it, they must have made a mistake, they made it for political reasons and not based on my skill, etc.

My current therapist says it has something to do with not being taught how to appreciate things - how to connect with that feeling of appreciation. Essentially, a deep feeling of not-being-good-enough means I don't let myself feel the emotional rewards of anything until I feel I've ""earned it"", which thanks to the feeling, never happens. She's probably on to something, but no matter the situation, I can't seem to make those connections, even if I can act on them.

Maybe it's a support thing. I have friends, but I don't ever talk to any of them. I don't have anyone that I tell news to when things happen - I've tried, but all my friends always seem weirded out by my sharing. When I do talk to my friends, it's brief conversations about shared interests, so always surface level stuff. My wife is incredible, but we're so completely different. We have almost no common interests, have basically opposite personalities, and even our ways of talking are so different that we constantly misunderstand each other, so giving each other the support we need is difficult and foreign. I honestly can't explain why we have the bond that we do, but it is genuine, and despite the differences the marriage is strong, and despite not being able to feel it, we know we love each other and are loved ourselves.

My social skills are, without hyperbole, autistic. I myself am not autistic, but conversations are impossible for me. I never know what to say, unless prompted. Someone says ""How are you?"" and I say ""Good, you?"" and they respond. If they don't say anything else, I don't know how to continue the conversation. I sit in awkward silence. I've asked someone how they are three times in a row before. I know I'm supposed to say something, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is. I see other people do it with ease, but it's always just... ""how did you know to say that thing you said?""

So I just don't know how to connect positively, I guess. As a result, I'm constantly miserable, and negative, and just... an asshole. And I hate it. And I want to be better, but I've hit this wall where it seems like I can't be better until I can connect with something good, and I just... can't figure out how to do that, even though I know how to do it, and I follow the steps and... nothing.

I have that stupid voice telling me to delete this, that it's a bunch of rambling nonsense and no one on here is going to care. That probably means I should post this.

You,"Every day I wake up and think of you.  I wake up and find myself further and further away from you.  The summer mornings feel colder, and no blankets but your jackets could keep me warm.  The mornings you'd send me a text to check up on me gave me a warmth that no family could fill.  The scent of your cologne and the grass beneath us both as I watch you close your eyes, the sun glinting off your hair like copper, and when you *smiled*.  It was like the sunrise after months of night.  You.   You are the reason I feel.  You are the reason the sun rises on the moon. You are the reason pictures start to dance. You are the reason things make sense.  Or, were, I guess.  I still remember all those times we'd lay in the grass listening to songs, songs that I can't listen to anymore, because they remind me too much of you.  I remember trying to fall asleep on your shoulder because i'd only slept five hours that night, again.  I remember all the concerned messages from you because you hadn't seen me at breakfast when I'd slept in.  The times in class when you'd just hug me and watch me take things apart, and whisper compliments in my ear.  When you'd remind me to drink water, again, because I was being an idiot and getting dehydrated.  It was... the best I think I've ever been.  Then camp ended, we video called almost every night.  I was so happy, but... were you?  You started playing games every night, trying to escape everything because I was making you worried, and eventually the worry and pain overtook you and you left.  you left.  So you do you, I'll live my life, we can ignore each other, pretend the other person doesn't exist, but deep down we both know it wasn't supposed to end like this.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
My partner is tired of my depression. What now?,"For the past year, I'm arguably at my all time low. Lost my  job a year ago and couldn't get myself back together since. When covid rolled around, fuck me.

My partner for the last 4 years (we're long distance as she's abroad for school) witnessed me slipping down and down the slope throughout the year. With patience and understanding, she was always there. Now, she's getting tired of it and she admitted it. Not sure if she still loves me the same, but one thing is for sure, she's tired of putting up with the episodes. ""im not so sure if i can put up with this the rest of my life."" but she still remains, still providing what support she can spare. We're still okay, at least for now. 

I see the merit of hearing the call to leave me. I also know that she's gotta do what's best for her.

I'm happy for most of the time, or at least I can be happy but I'm actually depressed deep inside and I dont know why. A long time I coped these feelings with drugs and alcohol but stopped because i knew it wasnt good. 

I just dont want it to get worse again because dying is the only thing I can think of right now","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
"My mom told me she hated me, asked me to never contact her again and called me a “low life b$;!?” I would never use such words to my children. I don’t understand how a parent couldn’t love and support who she birthed? Hurt.💔😞","Relationship with mom was never great as a child, but I always made excuses for her. She really never held the responsibility of my raising it was always amongst someone else. I don’t feel like I was ever raised; I think I was only ever “baby sat”. I don’t understand why my family never gave me away to someone who would have loved me? I was always moved from place to place as a child within different family members. Just long enough for a person to get tired of me and then moved to the next house until I was forced to take care of myself at 16 years old and nobody has cared for me since. It hurts living in the world and needing advice and support but having no one to turn to because all you remember is only ever having yourself. I remember living with family members and only having two outfits and at a young age I was forced to wash my own clothing because no one would do it for me. I have no choice but to think back at these times when looking for advice and support because I never have had anyone. My mom thought she was doing a deed to keep me away from my father as a child; now I’ve grown up to have no one. I resent her for it. But I’m ready to move on; how do I let all of this pain go so I can be happy in life? It’s easier said than done; been trying to do it for years.

"Tale as old as time: live-at-home, depressed 30 year old with no job. My 20s are gone. Are my best years behind me?","I’ve been severely anxious and depressed for half of my life. 

I was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago since two of the most insane experiences of my life (ie hypomanic episodes that led me to do things that have left me traumatized). 

I’ve basically been just existing. Not truly living, but not committed to killing myself. Just an animal that wakes up, eats, and repeats. 

On the upside, I’ve recently committed myself to change. 

What inspired me to write this was a post I saw on Reddit asking 30+ year olds to give advice to people in their 20s.

As I start a new and, hopefully, more positive chapter in my life, I realize my 20’s—the period that most people hold up to the light and call the most experimental, adventurous, and free time of their lives—is gone for me. 

For me, my 20’s was filled with a tremendous amount of fear and sadness.

As I enter my 30s, there’s more pressure than ever to have accomplished something “adult”. People are getting married, buying houses, getting promotions, switching careers...

I have no idea who I am. 

My personality has withered away. The weight that’s been on my chest is only just lifting, and all that time that others have had to explore and discover themselves is gone from me. 

Now, it’s time to put on a tie and plunge myself into the rat race. I feel cheated, behind, and angry. 

Can anyone relate? How do you think differently? More optimistically? 

Am I wrong about this?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
"I'm extremely suicidal, but don't have the balls to commit :/","Umm I'm not good with this kind of stuff, so sorry in advance. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for years now and it's gotten to the point where I'm having suicidal thoughts and breaking down everyday. I feel really lonely. That's the best way to put it, I feel that I annoy people so much that they just choose to ignore me.  


Different topic, but similar premise (I think) I'm scared of my mom, I can tell she doesn't like me that much and she's said to my face that she has a favorite child (I'm not it) I'm afraid she's gonna hit me or get so fed up that she disowns me.

I have very strong kinds of weakness/lack of energy/always tired/pain what effects my body. 
That is the reason why i get upset and can't believe it will get better because i got it maybe bout 3 years. 
This physical struggles are killing me and on the other hand depression kicks in.

I wish there whould be a way to escape this problems, but it doesn't seem so.
It's since puberty with the depression, and got even worse with all the physical symptoms.

advice on intrusive thoughts?,"So a couple of months ago, I did a thing where I memorized some phone number of a person that I don't get along with anymore. This has caused me to go on bouts of depression, lamenting about how my brain only memorizes information that is irrelevant, and how I wish I could forget everything.

Long story short, it was a terrible friend breakup that developed into all kinds of mental illness, including OCD. I get the feeling sometimes that if I don't look to see what this person is doing, I feel like death. This is harmful for me, because I know that it's a habit that I've made and I've now put a lot of weight in this. I told myself during corona that I want to start focusing on doing better and being better. All of this has weighed me down for 3 years now.

How do you guys deal with intrusive thoughts? Is there a way to purposefully forget information? I feel like the amount of work I've been putting in has been pretty good so far, but I can always be doing better. There's no pathways for this shit.

I've given up trying to change because all I do feel less and less bad for myself when I fail," 

I'm  an 18 year old male. I've been able to do nothing but reject any help I  get or fail trying to get myself back on track. Nothing really  motivates me, other than distractions so I'm not reminded that I won't  be able to keep myself alive in the real world. Any support I receive  now is all I rely on, and I have no reason to be lazy and unwilling to  do anything about myself. Yet whenever I try, I always wind back to the  start. I surround myself with positive people, but all I manage to do is  shower them with support instead of myself. I'll admit, it's because I  know they'll use that support to succeed, unlike me. I used to be afraid  that I'd always be like this, but now it's just a reality I've  accepted, and it's made me bitter and unintentionally hostile towards  those who know more about me than the carefree mask I put on.

I  like to think that when I get I job money will motivate me. It won't.  I'll just be stuck in my own world and just accept the fact that I've  been fired after a week. I've tried before. It's done nothing. It's a  problem that affects all aspects of me. All of them. And it makes me  feel like less of a person when I see others get back up from worse.

When  other people lash out at me for being defiant and wasting their  support, or not being of any use or having any real reason to be kept  around, I just sit there and take it with a blank face. They tell me  things I already know, then try to lighten it by them just being angry  in the moment, or just trying to get me to wake up. I know what they say  is true, and I can tell that they hope to God that I come to my senses  and start improving myself. I've been this way as long as I can remember  and nothing good has happened. I've only become more numb to the  situation and more accepting of my failure. I used to care. Alot. Now I  just try to look like I care until I'm alone, so I can have nobody else  but myself to blame. For some reason that's a more comforting thought  than anything.

I hate being like this. I just want to know why I'm nothing more than a waste of time that's sometimes a little funny.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Specific activities to ease loneliness and depression while living alone in the time of COVID?,"I (23F) have been living alone since ending a 4-year emotionally abusive relationship in October 2019.  I loved my new independence, then quarantine hit.  I went through another horrific breakup in March - he broke up with me in a truly cruel way the day before the shelter-in-place order hit.  My best friends have all moved 100s of miles away to be with their parents during quarantine.  After 82 days of basically solitary confinement, I started hanging out (safely) with acquaintances in June and I visit my parents almost every weekend.

I'm trying dating apps, but the constant ghosting, mixed signals, and not getting matches is really bringing me down.  I have had depression, anxiety, and OCD for 10 years but in quarantine it's the worst I've ever felt.  I am an attractive woman, but no one wants to date me and everyone I've ever dated has either been emotionally abusive or lied to me to get to my body.  When I do meet someone who expresses interest, they inevitably ghost me.

I just got a prescription for Zoloft because my Citalopram is clearly not working anymore.  I am hoping to feel better on Zoloft, but I don't have much hope.  A medication will not give me friends, or make men interested in me, or open up all my favorite places that have closed due to the pandemic.  

Because my depression stems from my unfortunate life circumstances, I am seeking advice on specific things I can do to pass the time and take my mind off of how sh\*t my life is right now.

Everything Feels Too Overwhelming,"I feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day.

I quite my job in January to “live my dream” of being a full-time artist. I am failing so hard. Yes, COVID really impacted everything but if I’m being completely honest, I was never cut out for this to begin with. I’ve taken on commissioned work that is months overdue because the thought of starting is so overwhelming. I keep telling myself, “tomorrow I will start” and I feel relieved.

I wanted to make art today (first time in months) and even got excited at the idea of going to the art store, but then I just thought “it will just be another piece that sits there and goes unfinished”. I killed all of my excitement before I even did anything. This isn’t me. I used to love to create art more than anything and spent almost every spare second painting.

I haven’t started and I feel guilt and shame everyday. I feel stuck. I can’t start and I feel like absolute shit for my behaviour.

I also “run” an online vintage shop. I built the new website back in February and was SO proud and excited about it. I haven’t touched it since. I want to, I want to work on it, but now I have SO many pieces of clothing that need to be cleaned, photographed, listed, measured, that it’s- again....overwhelming. I can’t bring myself to start and just look at all the beautiful clothing just sitting there every single day.

Some days I scroll through my phone for hours because I’m looking for a sign or a solution. I’m wasting my life. I hate feeling this way. I hate living this way. I’m unhappy no matter what I do and I’m feeling SO much guilt for letting so many people down. 

I’m 30 years old- too old to be acting this way. It’s so shameful. I also keep thinking that it’s too late for me to make any changes.

Am I depressed or just sad?,"I don't really know anymore, my art don't feel right despite feeling happy about the final outputs, my friends sound like they only talk to me for needing something without being obvious. I have been eating less and i'm losing my will to play video games along with my other hobbies. I don't want to leave my house anymore despite being a regular at a local cat cafe. As this pandemic worsens as I am stuck at home and the choices are thinning out even the new hobbies. Reading books help me but it's only temporary.

DAE Want to reach out for help but know it could just make you feel worse?,"I'm going through a backslide right now and I almost want to ask those around me for help on things like checking in to make sure I got out of bed today or have eaten something since I have a tendency to starve myself. I feel like I should be open about what I'm dealing with, but I also know that if I do, I'll feel weak, like I'm putting my illness on their shoulders, and that they'll suffer because of me. I was suicidal not long ago and I feel myself returning to some of the thoughts that accompanied those feelings. I feel terrible for what I must have put them through, thinking I was going to die and the last thing I want to do is put them back in that position. I feel guilty asking them to help me because I don't know if they can break me out of negative cycles. Only I can get myself in a healthy mindset.

She is happy now and im glad she is  but for me it is getting just worse by the day. Now i stay in my room, cry all day listening to music and imaging that we are tougher even i know it will never happen. I cant even be mad at her because i understand why she didn't want me that way, i mean i wold do the same in her place...

Nothing helps. No matter what I do.,"My depression consists of lack of interest in all of the hobbies I have, disassociation from friends and family and not caring about them, mental fog that causes me to make mistakes at work which I'm then yelled at for, fear of death and meaninglessness that takes over me, and feeling worthless and incompetent at life. 

It doesn't matter that I eat clean, exercise regularly, write my thoughts down, meditate, force myself to practice my hobbies, go to work nearly full time, take classes, keep my car and living space clean, force myself to socialize, or try to be what is generally accepted as a good person. Life is fucking miserable. 

I can't make sense of anything. If I try to make a point, an argument shuts it down. Then I question my view, change it or adapt it, then argue that point, then it gets shut down. It's as if there is no truth in the world at all and nothing is real. It's so goddamn frustrating it makes me break down. And then I think about how I'll never be like a normal person who can just be themselves and move on with their lives. I feel guilty for everything I do that I cant prove is the right thing. 

I just wan't to die all of the time and I even think about it in the middle of working or playing music, even during these intense moments where I should be focused I can only long for death and a cessation to the pain. I'm also in physical pain from multiple injuries that are long term and past drug abuse which I'm sure fucked my body up. I'm too afraid to actually kill myself because I know I'll just go into a void and my go clings onto life selfishly. I probably don't deserve to live though I make sure to tell myself I do. It doesn't help. 

I just wan't one thing to make sense in life, but everything is so confusing and I'm no good at any of it. I'll start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 2/3rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes. I'm trying to stick with my career goal of becoming a teacher but at this rate I'm still like 4 years away and I'm already 21, making minimum wage. I'm an absolute loser who nobody could love because I have no confidence. Confidence pisses me off, I just try to do what's required of me to get to where I need to be and that alone crushes me. Who could love somebody that has to fight to get themselves out of bed every morning? If I try to love myself, I just realize I'm lying about my accomplishments and I'll take it too easy on myself and not get anything done. I should be squashed like an insect for being so useless. 

I just want somebody to blow my brains out and rid the world of my incompetence and then nobody would have to worry about me. Everyone worries about how many mistakes I make, how much I fuck up, how I can't keep my shit together consistently and just keep running in circles. I'd rather just admit defeat and die. And so many people in the world probably think those like me should. 

I'm beyond saving it feels like and my brain is too fried to cling to any one thing. I just wan't everything to be true so I can stop worrying about being wrong all the time. 

I don't even make sense anymore.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My (24) boyfriend (30) told me having a child is the only point of life and if he found out he was infertile, he would kill himself.","Cross posted in r/relationshipadvice because theyre all telling me to break up with him and not offering advice for the helping him not want to kill himself part....

I don't know what to do. I've been dating my boyfriend for just over a year (we had been friends with benefits for 3 years before that, so we've known each other a LONG time) and we discovered early on that he wanted children and I didnt. We decided to keep seeing each other but open the relationship since we knew it couldnt be long term and we both could look for other partners. He turned 30 this January and we broke up because he wanted to start looking for a partner to have children with but we got back together two weeks later because we honestly love each other a lot and love spending time with one another. Plus then quarantine happened, so I assumed we would be able to continue as is to keep having each other to comfort and love when its basically impossible to start dating new people...

Recently when I'm not spending the night with him at his place, he'll get extremely drunk and sad and not tell me. He texted me this morning that he got drunk last night and called a girl he impregnated 4 years ago who then got an abortion. He said he had to come to terms with the fact that he couldve had a four year old child now.

Today I called him and he's been drinking all morning (as of noon) and he was watching bojack horseman and crying. He says the only reason he's depressed is because he doesnt have a child and the only reason he drinks is because he's sad that he doesnt have a child. But he loves me and is sad because I have the ability to change my mind and decide to have a child but i won't. And so naturally i said, oh but you could decide to not have a child and be with me forever, why is the impetus only on me? Then he said having a child is the only reason to be alive. He wants to see me pregnant and watch our child go to school and comfort them if they got bullied etc. He wants someone to take care of him when he gets old. Biologically, having a child is the only point of living and so having a child would cure his depression. I asked him what he would do if it turned out he was infertile and he point blank, no hesitation said he would kill himself.

So that was extremely scary. I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried to get him to go to therapy, but he sees absolutely nothing wrong with his worldview and i dont know how to convince him otherwise. Obviously, it is okay if we have to break up because our life paths are different, but honestly, he's done a lot of drugs (weightlifting/bodybuilding related) and there is a very real possibility that he's infertile. I love him to pieces and will be crushed if/when we break up, but I dont know what i would do if he killed himself.

Does anyone have any ideas for how to show him that the point of life is not only having a child? And yes, i did mention adoption which would provide the same ""tribe"" and care for him when he's old that he's so fixated on but he said he didnt want to adopt. Im just really worried and scared right now.

Thank you all in advance.

TL;DR - my boyfriend thinks having a child is the only point to being alive and if he cant have a child he would just kill himself. I don't want a child but i also dont want him to kill himself.

I feel like dying a lot,"I lost my job. They didn’t even call to tell me. I had to find out myself by seeing I was removed from the company website.

Chronic pain is really bad lately and my doctor is taking forever to get me treatment.

My grandma died a few months ago.

My dog died 2 months ago... i can’t stop crying for her. She was my baby- I mean that so much. It hurts so much nonstop.

I’m facially disfigured and make everyone uncomfortable. No one likes being uncomfortable so they avoid me. It’s been a hard life and no one ever wants to know about it. I went thru so much, overcame so much and no one cares. 

I want a best friend so much. The girl I thought could become this, my old coworker, isn’t going to be that for me. I’m not mad. But it hurts a lot. I miss her and wish we could’ve been closer. I really thought we could be super close best friends.

I’m so lonely, it’s like choking. The grief is so much. Insomnia is worst it’s ever been.

Seeing a therapist. On medication. Not suicidal. So don’t mention it please. I’m so tired of people giving me suicide hotline numbers and saying see a therapist. I feel pushed away when that happens now. I’m so tired of being ignored and invisible. 

I don’t know what’s so wrong with me for people to not want to be around me. 

I love life and living. But this is so painful and hard this year. I miss my old job where I was running the show and worked in a dream team with my mentor.

I’m working on building my own stuff all day everyday. It keeps me busy and my mind off depression. But some days are really hard like today. 

What do I do anymore? No one talks to me even though I’ve put myself out there. I’ve said my feelings to them and it doesn’t matter. I can’t go out bc of the pandemic.

is this a normal for parents to do?,"When i was like 11/12 years old someone had done a poo in the toilet and left it and my Mum found it and both my brother and I said that we didn’t do it. 
So my Mum made us both bend over in front of Dad and her and wiped our bums for us and then showed everyone the piece of toilet paper and whether it had shit on it or not.

I remember her telling us to bend over more because she said she couldn’t reach. 

My subconscious and conscious is telling me i’m a horrible person for saying this about my parents and that i’m just imagining it. But i know i’m not. It’s killing me not being able to remember things from this event and from when my Mum left.

The next parts foggy but i know that the first part above is definitely accurate 

I think my Mum wiped my bum and got shit on the paper and blamed it on me or something idk. And then i think my brother had shit on his paper as well. I think we were both ridiculed. 

I have many traumas involving my parents since then. I’m now 18. And i’ve been in an emotionally incestuous relationship with my Father. 
My brother beats me. And my Mum doesn’t do anything because she feels powerless because she’s now a single mother (my parents are separated) 

I also reported my brother to the police last year for touching my boobs and beating me with a belt (which my mum saw). But nothing happened and i don’t think the police believed me because i was overweight.

I am wondering if you guys have any insight into why depression can push individuals to act so out of character—almost as if they believe everything is completely okay when, in reality, they are suffering on the inside.

I’ve been dealing with persistent depressive disorder for the past 10 years, in and out of therapy (in currently), on and off of meds (off currently), and I just have no idea what to do anymore.

"How do I tell my SO that I'm depressed, numb and think about suicide daily?","Hello redditors!
(Throwaway Account)

I've been depressed for several years now and because I have a hard time feeling any emotions at all I just pretend to and play along for the majority. I am not actively suicidal anymore but I still think about it daily and I cannot shake the automatic ""... guess I can always kill myself"". 

Only my best friend who is in a similar state of mind knows how I feel and the rest of my friends and family have no idea and I don't want to tell them for several reasons. 

I live with my SO and we have been living together for 2 years now. I think she knows that I am ""feeling blue"" a lot but I am certain she doesn't know how severe it is. 

Recently I have been thinking about how I could start a conversation if I chose to do so but I don't know how because she is emotionally unstable sometimes (but not clinically depressed and only short periods of time). 

I am afraid that confiding in people will only make my living situation worse without actually helping my state of mind. 

I don't know what responses this may get but thanks anyways.

I was bullied for a few years at kindergarten and school and I get yelled at by mom. A lot of people told me that those are not reasons to be depressed, that I'm just exaggerating and I'm an attention seeker.

I feel like they're right?? There are a lot of people who are going through worse stuff and they're not able to get help. Someone else definitely needs that hour of therapy more than me.

My mind is very mean to me lately. There's this kind of voice who is telling me that I'm just a lazy piece of shit who is faking their own illness for attention. This makes me feel even more shitty. I can't take it anymore.

I'm not diagnosed because my mom doesn't allow me to get therapy and I rarely go to the doctor only if absolutely necessary.

Depression Treatment Options,"MDD for the past 2 years. Bipolar, depression, and anxiety all run in my family very prevelently, but none have received any kind of treatment (except lithium for a bipolar grandparent). I’m currently considered treatment resistant. Onto my 5th antidepressant now. Done SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, and Buspar (dont know why my doc thought that one was a good idea, I dont have anxious symptoms). I’m beginning to think oral medications are not the route for me unless perhaps a tetracyclic or MAOI works out. I’d be interested in trying lithium because I know it has helped a family member and I have also been (mis?)diagnosed as bipolar, so maybe it could work? I’m going to bring that up to my new psychiatrist tomorrow.

TMS and ECT sound like great options except the price tag. My insurance would only cover half, so I’d still be paying upwards of 10k for treatment. Not something I can afford. So I need to look for something else that I could possibly try that’s cheaper. And yes, I’ve done psychotherapy and group therapy, and it doesn’t help in the slightest. I’ve looked into alternate medicine like acupuncture, although i doubt its efficacy (my theory is that it works solely due to the placebo effect. and that hasnt even worked for things i thought would work for me). Perhaps clinical trials could be an option, but that’s not necessarily treatment for me. I’ve been suggested to try an outpatient program or check into a psych ward but I’ve heard bad things about them. Plus, I’m not sure how my treatment would be any better than just going to a psychiatrist on my own.

How to deal with the cyclical triad of draining symptoms,"Over the past months my depression has progressively become more disruptive. I’m now to the point where I’m stuck in a cycle of anxiety during the day, insomnia at night, and anhedonia all throughout the day. It’s definitely affected my work as I know and feel I’m not as efficient and poignant as I used to be, and I fear that I’ll lose my job due to lackluster work. Outside of increasing my SSRI dose with my doc, how can I overcome this if I can’t find therapy right now due to pandemic?

Much of my depression I feel comes from loneliness. I’m a man in my late 20s and I’ve never had a true best friend or romantic partner. I hoped this year would be that year because I found a job in a city I wanted to live, and it felt like a chance at renewed life. I accepted before the shutdown, and started after restrictions were in place, so I’ve spent the entire year alone in a new city as all social avenues were cut off.

The days have nothing to offer for me: Looking for projects or hobbies to ease depression,"Hey girls and guys,

I'm suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. Today I'm 21. My symptoms are mainly anhedonia (disinterest and joylessness), lack of drive, motivation and ability to get stimulated, painful negative thoughts starting right in the morning when I open my eyes (about past, present, future, that I don't have anything to offer, that I'm disabled, that future life has nothing to offer for me etc.), lethargy, low mood, sadness, cognitive restrictions (memory, focus, access to knowledge and thoughts) and irrational social anxiety.

I wake up and see nothing that waits on me, nothing that I wait for or am up to or interested in, no drive or motivation to stand up, nothing that drives me (anhedonia again). I then think what reasons or motives do other ""normal"" people see when waking up? I feel so empty about what the day has for me. Only thing I can see is food, maybe. Even food is no drive for me, I don't eat that much and don't feel the need to eat, I suffer from lack of appetite due to depression.

Sure, I don't have much self worth or confidence at all. I don't have many things I'm passionate about or I'm good in. I see the connection: no things you're passionate (drive) or good at (feelings of success giving self worth) =&gt; depression. I still do things. I have a side job, not quite good in it. I study psychology, 5th semestre already, not quite good in it. As already mentioned my cognition turned incredibly bad, I always think I'm dumb and unable to follow conversations, intellectual topics and such. Studying and university tasks or contents are very hard for me. I play tennis but rarely, quite good in it. I used to go to the gym, was boring but still quite good for distraction and feelings of success. I produce digital music, quite good in it and makes fun when I have a good day. I would love to play tennis and visit the gym more often but 1. they all contain socializing as there are people, so my social anxiety makes it incredibly hard for me and 2. now there is Corona. Other things like academic aspects, going deeper into a topic, studying neuro science or pharmacology (esp. neuroscience was a love of mine, I spent a lot of time with it and it was the reason for me starting the bachelor in psychology) is almost impossible for me because depression makes me dumb, disabled and very restricted in thinking or making.

I'm sorry for the long text. Thanks to everyone who read until here. What are your thoughts?

Do you have experience with this and somehow managed to improve the situation and feelings?

Do you have ideas for projects or hobbies I could try to get into and maybe find a passion in to kill my feelings of emptiness, negative thoughts and self worth issues? I would be happy about any idea, anything, that's somehow manageable even when being depressed and socially anxious. Something I can hold onto, improve in and get feelings of success and self worth or skill. Something that distracts me from negative thoughts and psychological pain of depression.

Have a nice day, I wish you the best! &lt;3","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
My girlfriend died and then before i could get any closure for myself covid came around and i haven’t even gotten a chance to talk it out with anyone,"To begin with i am a 17 year old guy, who used to be in a four and half-year long relationship. Now, initially, we were just best friends who thought of the term girlfriend and boyfriend as a special friend and decided to well start dating. She had an insane amount of problems on her side of the family, her parents were in prison, her siblings both dead and a shit ton more. So a big chunk of our time was me supporting her, comforting her and so on, and well i ended up getting really attached. I was so close to her that i ended up developing somniphobia which was something she struggled with and not me. 

2 years ago my grandfather went ahead and killed himself, which came as a massive shock to both of my parents, who had spent over an year to get him back in shape both mentally and physically. During that entire time span, I ended up being neglected and would only talk to my girlfriend. We were very close and would talk almost 4-5 hours daily, so when she got caught up in a car crash and suddenly passed away, i didn’t take it well and i still don’t.

Neither my parents nor my siblings know anything about this, since my household is not supportive of relationships till i become 18. Its been almost 11 months now and i need someone to help me get over her.

Anyone have advice how to? I’ve tried a lot of stuff such as:
Meditation
Gymming 
Exercise
Focusing on studies
Therapy

None of those helped me that much, would appreciate some advice!","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

How do I stop the fear of getting too attached to people?,"Hi everyone,

A bit brave for posting this on my main, but here it goes.

My 'attachment' to people is a big issue. It has definitely led to heart ache, sadness, and disappointment.

So - I got this great job a couple of months ago, every day was a challenge and something new. My colleagues are great people - I genuinely love speaking to them, and just overall having a good time.

But - I have an issue of getting too attached to people and not interpreting signals correctly. This eventually leads to the other party to not dealing with me anymore (I don't really blame them to be honest) and just... cutting me off.

This has eventually developed into me not opening up - or being personable with people as I am simply too scared of this attachment growing. Sometimes they message me out of work (We all have each other on social media, big mistake on my end!) and I just leave on seen or reply blandly, or sometimes in the middle of a conversation I just never reply, simply because I feel like this will go down the same road as before, just being too attached.

Every day I struggle keeping myself composed (I take photos just to get my head off things, this is the only thing that gets me going through the weekend).

Should I tell this to my colleagues? Should I keep it a secret? I really don't know. At the end I'm just not happy with how I am. I get suicidal ideations every single night and just remembering the relationships/friendships that I have fucked up literally gives me anxiety and it has definitely caused some sort of trauma.

I don't go through with suicide because I just think of my parents on how sad they will be. But - once my parents pass away I am planning to fully commit as I really don't want to live this crippling anxiety with every single relationship/friendship.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
Can a 14yo have depression and anxiety,"Hey, a few informations: I'm on mobile, not a native english speaker, my father divorced and unable to see him/ only at weekends) , middle child of 6, game addict(really bad 5-8h a day), smart and dumb, lot of people say that I'm gifted and mature for my age.
I was the normal trouble child. Good but not too good grades. My older siblings use drugs (alcohol, weed, Shisha and Cigarettes) and were raised (like me) old school (getting slapped) like me, it was normal in Germany. I didn't have the same father as any of my siblings. I entered first grade and was a weird child because of my Nigerian side that wears other clothing once a month and almost bold hair(cut every month to like 2mm). I was darker than anybody (darkest at school) and only a few friends. My father pickt me up one day and they realise why I was brown/light skinned and started bullying me. They called me things like burned chocolate muffin and other 4th grader insults. After the 4th grade we all enter a new school(in Germany you Enter a new school after 4th grade with exceptions) all the people where really nice and I started to become the main class clown. Got in trouble a lot and the grades where dropping and I got neglected more at home (I didn't got attention in my family so I want it in school) and our family (which was already broken) got broken more. My sister was /is an entitled bitch and my mother an angel who wants to do their best. The problem is that my mother does this in a completly wrong way and scars us even more. And all their trouble is going straight to me and my small siblings. I sometimes ask my mother what depression feels like(she had depression in her 20s)and she always said ""you can't have depression you're to young"" which is always hurting. Because I think she doesn't care enough and always talks shit about my father and the other way too. She only cares about my grades that's why I show her the good ones and false signature the bad ones (it works they only look over it)after I realise that I was thinking about suicide how I should do it which ways there are and what last messages I would give to anybody I love. This got worse and worse until I thought about suicide almost everyday. I also had a crush on a girl who toyed with me and always said stuff like ""I miss you"", ""I like your curls"" or ""let's go out some more"" we never go out alone. We had my 14 birthday this summer and I threw a party (she's 16 so alcohol was involved) and we start leaving the people and going to bed to cuddle(we didnt had a condome) and dry humped she always made me hope that someday we could be. We are one day in school and we got a new student. They where together after 2 days they didn't know each other. I also tend to forget how to walk when near people my age and try to avoid contact even with eyes. I don't go to social gatherings anymore bc of this (and covid).
So I dunno if I have depression cause I felt no joy in the last 2 years. But I also don't want to be an 14yo deep fake depression boy so I didn't talk with no one about this(other than 2 friends)

"Please help, i am so tired","Can someone please explain?

So i dated this guy one year ago. He became severely depressed and we kept texting when he felt like it. He doesn’t really talk to me about it because he doesn’t want to burden me (it’s annoying). He is seeing a therapist once a week and is taking all kinds of medication. 

I made him a christmas package. With gifts, food, and a selfmade depression journal (see my other post). And i can’t wait to cheer him up with it. 

I texted him last Thursday if i could bring it. He seemed happy about it and we agreed to meet that evening. But then he texts me last minute saying his best friend is at his place and he forgot they were going to have diner together. He then gave me all kinds of new options, and I then asked if today was okay, but i still didn’t get a text back... (it has been 3 days)

I don’t know what to do anymore. Should i send him another text? Ugh I am trying to support him but he keeps letting me down every time. 
He is with his best friend literally every second of the day, it seems like he can’t be alone. But he also seems to be unable to text me back? 

I don’t understand. I really don’t. I read books, i talked to you guys, and i educated myself about depression, but i am so tired. Can somebody please try to explain?

Struggling bad right now,"Ive (18m) been struggling on and off with my depression for around 3 years now. I started smoking weed to deal with school and now college stress but that in itself has done more wrong than good as now im not only dependent but now I constantly have to lie to my mum about what Im doing which just makes me feel even more worthless and a failure of a son, not to mention the astronomical money I spend on drugs in general. I am failing college, my last chance to get a good education, meanwhile all my friends who have since moved across the country for Uni haven't really kept in contact. The only people I see outside of work are the people who Im smoking weed with other than that I feel totally isolated. Every day I think of my death, how people would react and how Id do it. these thoughts went from being in the context of comfort while in a stressful situation to what feels like an inevitability ( in other words I dont think like ""if I was to kill myself..."" instead I think ""When I kill myself...""). on top of all this Im generally a clumsy person but also extremly self critical, whenever I make a dumb mistake it takes a toll on my mental state, every time I trip, stutter or whatever I feel totally worthless. I hate my music because it reminds me of hanging out with my friends who arent around anymore. There are more things but I dont want to ramble on. 

&amp;#x200B;

No one knows this is how I truly feel, not even those closest to me. When I first started going through this I drunkenly told my friend a few tid-bits but he didnt keep his word on not telling people so I decided to bottle everything up and pray that eventually my life would improve but since then its been a sharp decline. The reason Im writing this is because I feel someone needs to know even if its some guy 6500 miles away who knows nothing about me because I feel like if I told any of my friends it would change the way they see me plus I cant guarantee that whoever I told would keep it to themselves.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

Can depression cause a bad memory?,"
When I was a young teenager I was diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. My entire teenage years were dedicated to getting better and school / friends were not my priority. I still had friends, but I didn’t see them as much as most people see their friends. 
I went to a clinic to treat my suicidal thoughts and anxiety, so I missed out on a year of school.

I finally got better when I was 18, but now I am in my twenties and I’m realising that I barely have any memories from that time.
I do have some clear memories, but most are related to my depression, but I can almost never remember any fun stories my friends bring up, that I was apparently involved in. 
It’s 6/7 years of a weird blur. 

I keep seeing people posting pictures of themselves as teenagers, and talking about how crazy that time was and how much fun they had in high school. Their first job, their first boyfriend, their first drink.
I am glad I got to the point where I am doing a lot better. But I do feel like a I missed out on a huge part of childhood, and don’t have great social skills because of it.
I was wondering if it’s normal to have a vague memory of such a huge chunk of your life, and if depression could be to blame?

I REALLY need help,"I'm 24F. I'm sorry if my english it's bad, i speak spanish. I've always been a little sad, i mean, nothing to worry, i think, because i felt happy sometimes and used to enjoy things. I've always been too obsessed about the way i look, i think in a pathological level, avoided meetings because a felt ugly, don't eat or eating way too much, etc, so that's why i think this situation feels particularly hard. About a two months ago i thought i had a cavity in my tooth (i don't know the word in english for ""caries""). I stopped smoking. I went to the dentist, it wasn't that, she cleaned my teeth, but i was feeling like my four frontal teeth are moving, she said they don't move but i feel it. She said i have bruxism so maybe it's that, but i literally can't eat because i feel that movement and it driving me nuts.

I'm crying all day, i don't eat, i constantly think about killing myself because thats just my life, everything goes the worst way it can go since always. I don't have money to go to therapy, i tried to talk to people but they don't take me serious and say i ""should stop bother them"". My boyfriend really tried to make me feel better but nothing worked and i knew he felt frustrated and i think angry because of the way i talk, so i started to act like everything is ok.

"My depression has been so bad, no one has tried to contact me for months to check up and it tears me apart","I have never been on reddit before but I'm at my whits end on trying to find some sort of engagement with people online due to months of isolation and severe depression, because I feel I can't contain anymore of my sadness and loneliness. I have tried free online depression chat rooms and such but, really, I just need someone to tell me I matter. I don't know how this tends to work on Reddit but this is probably just going to be me venting. 

This year my depression has been so bad that my pessimism and slow bitterness and resentment with the world and everyone around me has scared me. I'm scared of how much I have internally changed as a person, my lack of empathy and willingness to care about others, and that has never been my character. This has never been shown through my actions, but I can feel this pessimism and bitterness poisining me internally. I have lost faith in everything, and because of that I eventually stopped coming online on social media altogether for months, both to deal with myself but also because I didn't want to end up acting toxic. I felt (and still do now) that no one cares about me, everyone is busy with their lives and their friends. I may have ""friends"", but they have THEIR friends who they give more attention to.  I have been online and have had ""friends"" or mutuals online who have known me for years, but I have always felt i simply cannot fit with them as they share a bigger bond with eachother. I've just always been a nice, familiar presence that they will interact with regularly. But I have always had experiences of feeling left and felt like I do not matter as much. This applies to real life experiences to. People who just stop making the effort to contact me, under no particular circumstances or conflict. I have always struggled to make friends, and the only long distance friendship I had for over nine years also resulted in stopping contact from their part this beginning of the year. Everytime I've felt that my relationship with a person is stable and we connect and have known eachother for years, I get proven wrong. I now naturally feel intense instibility in friendships, or seeking out friendships in general, because I now expect people to already have a circle of close friends, and I can't be apart of that. And it keeps happening, even online mutual friends have not reached out to me despite seeing my personal posts and how much of a hard time I've been having this year. Even me disappearing for months did nothing. 

I feel intensely stupid and selfish, while at the same time feeling like if I had killed myself during these months of such bad depression, life would resume and no one would know. I feel stupid and selfish because I absolutely know its not people's responsibility to worry about me, especially when they are living their lives and are probably going through their own issues, and I shouldn't be throwing my frustration and bitterness on people. But it feels I've been just left in the dark while online mutuals who have known me for years, continue to enjoy their interactions with eachother and pretend nothing is happening unless they want to engage in a post thats not a personal one. 

There's a lot of different issues in my life which have contributed to my diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but this year it feels like God wants to keep telling me no one cares for you. Til this day I don't know how people make lifelong friendships with people you have so much history and connection with. Maybe because of my own insecurities and outlook on friendships, I'm simply expecting something that normally isn't how it works. I just feel so suffocated whenever I'm online, its like I want to scream at everyone and say ""LOOK AT ME PLEASE, IM SUFFERING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS"" and for never paying attention when I suffered so much and continue to suffer, but want to interact with me on posts that are not about my personal mental health. What happened to making sure everyones okay? Do I not matter enough? Are they just sick and tired of me now? I can't even reach out in this kind of situation because again, I shouldn't be demanding people think about me.

I just wish my headspace wasn't so messed up. Recently, I anticipated that going back online and mentioning my suicide attempt would cause at least some kind of reaction from these mutuals, but nothing actually did happen. Since then I have completely shut down and cant function when I need to the most (exam season), its all just bad timing. But I'm more angry at myself because I basically asked for this, and when I didn't get the reaction I wanted I caused my own downfall. I know that I've caused my own isolation, my depression wants me to push people away so badly, and when I see people not making an effort on their side, people who I felt they would, its just tearing me apart. I really, really just want to disappear. I feel horrible for wanting people to feel guilty, but I'm so exhausted of feeling this way and I only want to be bitter and angry at the world.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0
I have no reason to be sad and yet here I am,"I don’t understand myself right now. I shouldn’t be feeling this way but right now I’ve been miserable for months. I’ve got a new, high paying job. My husband is loving and supportive and my family is loving as well. But I’m here at 2 in the morning sobbing again alone. I don’t do anything outside of work right now and my job feels miserable. I don’t feel like I’m cut out for it and I dread waking up in the morning. I don’t have the emotional energy to do anything else outside of work. Even scrolling through the internet can’t really keep my Interest anymore. It’s hard to focus on anything right now.

At work I find myself anxious with certain tasks for no real reason. I don’t like talking to people but that’s what I have to do all day and I’m growing to despise it. I feel like I’m not leading my team and I’m leaving them twisting in the wind. I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing and I want to quit but I can’t do that. 

I try not to be so negative and get out of my own head but I don’t know what to do. I don’t have the energy right now for a hobby. I’m barley eating these days, I can’t sleep and I’m taking 2-3 anxiety showers a day now. 

How do I get over this? I don’t understand myself. I should be sad all the time. Things are fine. And yet I’m in my own way right now and I feel like I’m letting depression ruin my life for no real reason. I don’t know. I just want to disappear right now. I find myself wishing I was sick or something just to be able to go away for a while.

Thought I would share this here,"Hi, my name is Sebastian and I really don’t know how to start this post, maybe because I’m afraid to be called whiny or whatever, but the truth is I’ve been feeling pretty down recently so I thought I would share what I’ve been feeling/thinking this past 3 months or so.

It is a well known fact that 2020 has been nothing short of horrible, but the reality is that, for me at least , it didn’t start that way. 

Beginning of 2020 was maybe the best I’ve ever felt in my life. To provide a little more context, I’m 19 rn, but back at January/ February I was still 18 and about to graduate from high school which I eventually did, with good grades, but here’s the issue: I graduated from a international German school which educates based on the German system “Abitur” which in short were some difficult exams that I studied my ass of to pass. Abitur also presented me with the possibility of going abroad for college.

All my short life I’ve felt kinda pressured to go abroad to study, since my father did it and always talked about how amazing it was, and my school was filled with posters of “study in Europe(mostly Germany) it’s a life changing experience”.
And so I felt on top of my game and started among at the very top: architecture in such places like Madrid,Berlin,Stuttgart,etc but most of all I wanted Barcelona because it felt so perfect on paper, like the best of the best , world wide known, top level technology, state of the art campus, and of course the city itself is an architectural delight( arguably the most famous architect , Gaudí is from Barcelona).

Looking back now, I was naive and didn’t appreciate what I had back home , but I had to prove the ones who bullied and looked down on me back in my school days , that I was better than them, and that was my first (of many) mistake: I went there looking for revenge so to speak.

Then everything developed so quickly I had barely any time to think , to my awe I got accepted in BarcelonaTech, I found a nice little bedroom on a student housing that was just beside Campus and I started preparing for my departure , which was going to be mid September bc the University had arranged some   introdution activities for new comers. It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me.

Problems started emerging in September, first of all it was difficult to find flights to Spain, but then on the night me and my father were supposed to fly, he checked to see if he had all the documents with him, and sadly his pass was past due. So I had to fly alone, and I had no time to process what had just happened, I had to stay  focused.
Then I received a mail from college stating that those introduction weeks had to be canceled due to Covid casing rising again in the city. 
I tried to pull through thinking all would be better once classes started, but soon after I got a second mail stating that classes would be mixed: so almost all classes would be takes online bar Maths and Physics.
Then the third mail came in stating that classes would be taking Online until further notice, possibly until March or february.

At this point I had a full on emotional breakdown all the anxiety, nostalgia, frustration and anger came rushing in , I felt I was lied to by College authorities, though they don’t control covid , they did tell me that for newcomers classes would be given at campus. So after 1 month I decided I had enough of my European adventure  and came back home.

This is where I guess my depression started.
I now have been accepted by a local Uni, but it doesn’t feel rewarding, as it should , it feels empty. I feel like a coward, a loser , like I was not good enough and gave up on my dreams. Like I will never have another opportunity to leave , and that I will be stuck here forever wandering “what if...” 
most of all I feel disappointed in myself and extremely sad, and though I do have my family’s support, I feel like they don’t quite get me, and frankly like they are running out of patience.

I don’t know, I guessed I needed a space to vent and let my thoughts and feelings out, although it may be silly.
I apologize for the long read, and I don’t want to sound like a pan y whiny brat with “first world problems” but , truth be told is that I didn’t knew what else to do to express what I’m feeling. Thank you , have a happy Christmas.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I'm not clincally depressed (hasn't be confirmed) but..,"I honestly feel like I should die and I'm a mistake, before you suggest it, I told my mom. She tried to be  supportive but I feel no better, it's gone on for long. Since I was 5-7. I'm honestly sick of faking being happy, I don't know what more to do.

# Why I wouldn't kill myself

I'm afraid of death, and even if I wasn't, there's nothing I could use. I'm probably ''too young'' anyways, that's probably why my mom shrugged it off. 

# Why I want to kill myself

First off, I have trouble getting to sleep, I hardly wake up in the night, it's just hard for me to get asleep. My mom has taken notice of that too. ''Over tired'' she calls it. Also, I'm super lonely, I have no friends, the only place I have friends is on the internet, but they're not on much, and when they are, I'M the one giving support. I get they have problems too, but I gave up so long ago. I'm also so scared of so many things. Falling into the sky, on a wall/the ceiling, that is a big problem for me when I look up in the sky or look up when I'm lying down. It just scares me, it doesn't affect my sleeping, but other ascepts. Failure. Nobody likes failure right? It's worse for me. I'm scared of failure because I feel if I fail then; nobody would like me, they would ignore me more, I would be more alone. I know it's not true, I just can't escape that fear.

I am 13 looking for help,"Hello I live at Hong Kong. I always felt stress at school or at home. I am kinda big in video games but my parents never agreed. They believe that school is the only way to success. If I said anything I researched. They would say I am crazy ( not really they but mainly my mom)

I also wanted to improve myself. I have friends at school but I just don't feel happy. I would cry everyday and I never felt joy outside of the internet. I think I might be addicted but I am not really at the same time. 

At school I never felt joy. And I am the top 5 student of my class. But I never felt any improvement. I am always doing the same thing wrong and tutor never helped me.

I hope one day I can be happy again. I also wanted to talk to teachers or parent but I never get the chance. I know I never work as hard as the best student. But I just never felt joy in school. 

These days I felt worst always having headaches and I am always dizzy. I wanted to seek for help and wanted to be happy. I also have been thinking of suicide but I am too scared to do anything.

I need some perspective,"Hello :)

I’ve been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder recently and I’ve just started trying to get help for mental health stuff. 

~The question I have is, does it ever get better? 

I’ve felt pretty much how I feel now for as long as I can remember (about 10 years I don’t have an awfully great memory). I only just realized that routinely thinking of suicide is not the norm but I’ve wanted to die for, well as long as I can remember. I am 20 now, I’m exhausted and I’ve tried everything I could possibly think of but I’ve really just been getting worse.

I’m a student and I have a really hard time keeping up with medication and therapy payments, and I’ve just become completely exhausted. I’m just worried that all the work I put towards getting better will amount to nothing (just off of the pattern of all my other solutions). 

I don’t want to be happy, I just want to feel okay. Any perspectives would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you :)

"I'm lost again, I got caught I'm afraid.","I haven't been able to see a doctor, or a professional who can diagnose and help me, I haven't been able to get up the courage to talk about this with anyone.

This year there were people who helped me, I was in a very bad situation and they literally saved my life. And thanks to them I was able to help many people in need, especially many children, to see the smiles on the faces of people who have been having a hard time, to see the hope coming back in their eyes has been the best thing that has happened to me this year, I honestly did not think I would make it to the end of the year.

I've been holding on, looking for ways to escape from this, there were moments where I was able to escape although I really don't know how long I managed to avoid it, there are songs that calm me down and make me stop thinking for a while, they make me feel like I'm getting out of my head and going to other places, The song ""Don't you worry child"" has been one of those, the chorus that says ""Don't you worry, don't you worry child see heavens got a plan for you"" has been like a kind of anchor, but every day I feel it working less, the unexplainable pain is coming back out of nowhere.

I don't know what to do, I'd like to have someone to go to, I'm alone and I have no one to seek refuge in. I had been able to keep it away, but it has caught up with me again, this feeling of

How do you find motivation to keep up with cleaning?,"I recently have come to a point where I can't stand the way I've been living and I feel as though my apartment being a mess is one of the main reasons for that. I've been working 50-60 hour work weeks for the past two months because it keeps me busy and keep my mind off things. However, I feel from this schedule of working and sleeping, working and sleeping I've gotten so far behind on taking care of myself and my apartment that just the thought of all the stuff I need to do is overwhelming. Leading me to barely want to get out of bed on my day off because I know how much I need to work on because nothing got done during the week. So I've decided to cut my hours down to 45 a week, although I'll have less money I feel like it will allow me more time to take care of my outside of work stuff so that I won't be so exhausted all the time.

Since an event that took place more than a week ago, on Sunday, I've realized how messed up I was and how unable I was to socialize and be with people. I've stopped talking about it to my family, because my father would shout at me again, my mother would joke about it and the others would judge me.

Student nurse with severe depression bout - how can I help?,"My fiancee is a student nurse after a career change and is currently in her second year. She had setbacks due to COVID and a broken wrist (which still requires a re-set operation that she is putting off because of training). Her last placement was absolute hell and she had deliberately obstructive staff rather than anyone who would sign off her competencies. She has a history of severe depression and is taking medication, but has really gone downhill for the last month or longer. On the worst days she is barely able to take care of herself and of course it puts our relationship under terrible strain, but I try to help and support where ever I can.

She feels trapped in this career path, and has admitted that she is continuing because she feels she has no other options, but I am genuinely afraid that it is killing her. She really wanted to be a community nurse and the ward shifts are taking a serious toll on her mental and physical health. I've tried to talk about finding other options or just ways to cope with the stress, but she's not really interested at this point.

How to motivate myself to start a virtuous cycle?,"I know that if I exercise, I feel a sense of achievement, I get endorphins from exercising and generally feel a lot more positive about things.

I have got a training plan arranged with either running or exercises to do six days a week (I thought the accountability would help) and I haven't done anything for over a week. 

I feel very little motivation to do anything which isn't helped by the fact it's so cold and miserable outside and gets dark quickly.

I know if I did get out there and go for a run or, if it's an alternate day, do my body weight exercises, then I'd feel a lot better about things, but I just can't seem to make myself do anything. In a normal holiday season we'd be visiting family and friends and going on days out, but that's not allowed due to my country's Coronavirus restrictions. Part of this issue is having absolutely no structure to my day.

I'm off work for the holidays so I stay in bed until midday feeling shitty, get up for lunch, drag my family to the park so the kids can get some fresh air, then come home and slouch until dinner, then go to bed when they do and spend the evening on my phone.

Shitty New Years,"Worst new year ever

It’s been 6 months of radio silence, an email from me, calls with no answer. We were raising my son together his he was 5 months old and we heard nothing from him. His excuse was the same one that he used all throughout our relationship to not be there for us- work is killing him. He owns a pizza restaurant.. and he’s a control freak so he basically does everything himself even though he pays employees then stressed himself out because he’s doing everything and working 16 hours a day. It ended with me asking for 1 hour a week of couple counselling because I know I have issues but he does too and needs to be able to make at least one hour a time a week for his family if it was ever going to work. His message was “ I miss you. happy New Years” and then from there it turned into him going on about his how shitty his life is without me.. even though apparently I was the reason he had no money ever and now it’s the same. I live off of less than half of his income, supporting my son in a two bedroom as opposed to his one bed- and somehow I have savings, even though I do have some bad spending habits ( fast food delivery 😬, and grocery delivery because sometimes I’m too anxious to leave the house and I need to cook for my son). Anyway so that was a mess. And then my friend with benefit that I was falling for.. that I thought maybe felt the same because he was driving an hour to see me, bringing me starbucks, offering to teach me how to drive and cook better, talking about maybe meeting my kid in the future, talking about taking me out clubbing after covid cause I’ve missed out being a young mom with no help; had a New Years party.. didn’t even think to invite me and posted on his snap grinding with some girl 10x hotter than me.. so I hate myself so much for thinking maybe I was special, maybe I meant something to someone in 2020 nope..","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

i’m out of depression now, or at least, i think i am... for the last 3-4 months. it’s just whenever i do something and i end up getting in trouble for it even though i genuinely thought what i was doing would help people out, i feel extremely mad at myself.

How do I(32F) support my husband (45M) through depression,"My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 5 and overall have a wonderful relationship. He truly is my best friend. We have worked through numerous issues and he's done a lot of work on his mental health, but refuses to go to any type of treatment (we also can't afford anything). He quit his job about a month prior to the pandemic hitting and has been unemployed since. He tries to supplement income with doing food delivery, but even that has slowed down as time has progressed (through no fault of his own, he schedules and works, but orders are far and few between). He has always struggled with anger and depression and has narcissistic tendendacies, but recognizes that and tries to work through it. How can I currently support him? He recognizes that he's spiraling into his dark place but doesn't think anything can help. Lack of income contributes greatly. 

At the start of the pandemic I helped him start a YouTube channel to give him something to focus on and have goals, but now that has just turned into more frustration and it's work as opposed to fun. 

Is there anything I can do to help him? I feel like my positive attitude is just making things worse.

Any advices you would like to share on uplifting self esteem and self awareness ?,"I have been facing depression over the past couple of years but it only accelerated last 6 months when I lost my job and moved back with my narcissistic parents.  

Thanks to my **over protective and overly concerned parents**, I turned out to be an adult who cannot standup to himself, who turned out to be a weakling, lack basic social skills and more importantly does not have the faintest idea who he is, what makes him happy, or the very least what he wants to do with his life.

I have been living **suicidal over the past 2 months**, researching on methods I could deploy to end this no good life, having no point in living. But to be honest, I guess somewhere down there, there is something that tells me that not all doors have closed. I recently had  a quick convo with a therapist and with the intial analysis she put forward with my situation, she mentioned that the probable root caus,e that is prone for a quick fix is my lack of self awareness and self esteem. I felt that is true, because I sort of feel like **I do not have an identity**, like.. Having an opinion on something/anything, having the strength to stand up to myself, knowing what it is that makes me happy, be it a hobby or an interest.

I mean when I spend time with people, maybe friends, or colleagues. **They tend to know a lot about the world.** Some may be knowledgeble about basic things people should know, some maybe a youtube content provider or some other maybe a social point of source. I want to do something with my life as well like being good at something, but **all I do is consume data/information** (reddit,trivial information etc..) and not produce any (maybe writing a blog) because I can't understand what fancies me.

Idk how to get my shit together,"I really don't. I've looked up stuff like ""how to get my life together"" and all the advice was very unhelpful. I know what I want and where I wanna be, I just don't know how to actually get there or anything. I mean, I'd do it myself but it's kinda hard, not to mention I'd like help with something for a change. 

My parents barely helped with anything before, and their eagerness to do so now is sort of annoying. I dont know what else to do really. I'm just lost, but I dont know how to get back on track. Not a lot of direction in my life, and I dont know how to give it to myself.

"""I'M WORSE THAN AN AUTOMATED BOT""","My online friend severely suicidal, and I'm completely useless to help her. 

My attempt to use advice from the depression/suicide talking tips sounds like a hotline script. 

Any advice is insulting, I know ""finding a hobby"" is not going to make her magically want to live. 

Telling her that I will miss her is just a selfish guilt trip.

I find that just listening and asking basic questions doesn't help because I know a depressing response will follow, and it comes off as cold/uncaring.

I have trouble countering the negative thoughts as she will often say, ""nobody cares about me"" and that's hard to hear as I care about her, but I do not want to invalidate her thoughts.

I once told her that I thought she was amazing, and she just responded that she knows herself better than I do and that she will never feel that way.

I want to do things and its like something is holding me back. Its hart to fight it, i try.

Its good thats only toughts how i go kill myself but i dont know how to handle it. Some days its not that hard but i cant even remember a day without that thoughts anymore.

My toughts are like these  annoying advertising pop up windows, these toughts sometimes appear out of nowhere and hit me hard.

The  psychologist who told me to think about somethingelse,... idk i can think about many things at the same time.. even if i try to get ried of these pictures in my head... it takes i while and the dissapear. Until then i sometimes wish i let these toughts become the reality... i dont harm myself so you dont need to worry about this!

but i do not want to live with these toughts until i died.

i could search for another therapist but i only get  disappionted. its hard to find someone.

I’m 15 and don’t want to live with my dad anymore.,"My parents have been divorced for 7 years and I go to my mom’s house weekdays, my dad’s weekends.

The main issue I have with my dad is that I simply can’t trust him. I can’t open up to him without him rejecting my opinion. Growing up with him has made me feel helpless, and living with him feels like giving him all the control. He has threatened to take my phone because I said I value emotional relationships more than comfortable living. He threatened to go to court and call the police if I refused to go to his house. I said I wouldn’t mind going for dinner and such, but he outright rejects my opinions.
He said it wasn’t my choice, and that just proves my point where I can’t trust him to respect my feelings.
He knows I have depression. He says he’s willing to change, but I don’t have the mental capacity to live with him if he doesn’t change by himself.

I live in BC Canada, so the age requirement for choosing who to live with is 19, but I researched about it and it said that the court will mostly decide for the child’s best interest. I’m terrified of the slightest possibility that my dad will win custody. At that point, I might as well kill myself.
My dad is a negative influence, a toxic personality. I cut out most toxicity from my life because it’s caused me to be depressed, and it’s why I don’t want to see him again.
I’m trying to compromise but I can’t live with him. I just feel upset and terrified right now.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Last night I feel the urge to end my life,"I’m not usually the type who writes about her personal situation in public. But last night, I felt that sense of extreme hopelessness about my life in general. I felt completely numb, empty, and at the edge of doing it. But then I thought about the people I’ll leave behind, esp my mom. i realized I need help. Seeking a therapist is probably the better option than venting out in this group. but being unemployed 32yo, and without savings, I guess sharing my situation is a more practical way of trying to get away from that urge to end things. 

I’m currently in a very cold country in the north, which makes it worse. i’ve no friends here. Its only frustrating and disappointing to make one. I’m educated but because of the language I cant get a job. I dont even know if I want to pursue a career.

Do you ever feel guilty for not doing enough to treat your depression? How do you deal with it?,"I keep falling into this terrible spiral of thoughts like “well, you would feel less depressed if only you’d exercise, eat healthy and keep the house clean,” but of course, living with depression means I rarely have the energy to do all or any of those things. And the more I kick myself, the more energy I lose, so I sit in bed, eat cookies and let messes pile up around me, which in turn makes me more depressed, and so on....

I’m on medication and in therapy, both of which help, but I get so down on myself for not being able to form better habits. I know I need to start small and to go easy on myself, but even then it’s a struggle. 

At the moment I’m more focused on how to deal with the guilt of not doing things, as opposed to strategies for accomplishing said things. I break through the cycle every so often (more often now with meds) and can be feeling good for a while....and then seemingly without reason, I fall back into the hole again.

My best friend's depression is triggering mine. What do I do?,"I've been depressed for years and hated all the thoughts of suicide that were stuck in my head. A month ago I finally opened up to my parents, things have brightened up, I seeked professional help last week, and might have some counseling with my fam soon. I've reconnected with people I've missed, and I'm really trying my hardest to stop feeling depressed. I've even started reading up on meditation and such. My doc and I are still thinking about the meds though.  


But my bestfriend...is suicidal and depressed, I'll call them John for now. He regularly has the urge to self-harm, skip meals, or do reckless things. And regularly talks about wanting to die and how he wants to do it.  I've given him a lot of advice and I've done my best to remind him that I'm always here. But....it's starting to feel like he never takes any advice I give and that he's given up on himself already. He already seeked help long before I ever did but he hates his meds cuz he thinks it just forces him to be happy. He's an online friend so I can't approach him face to face. I've known him for so long and I know that's he's a good person and that he doesn't deserve this. He wants a better life where he's free from his family...so I recommended some small job offerings to keep him stable but he doesn't want to commit to it. I recommended he find some hobbies...but he doesn't want to. I told him to try making new friends, he says he already has me... I tried to explain why that wouldn't be healthy and he seemed to try to say that other people will just hurt him...but I'm not perfect...I can't provide for all of his emotional needs...I barely have control of my own. I can't help but feel the need to play strong just so he has someone to lean on. I want to finally start thinking about myself and relax...but everytime I do I feel like I'm leaving him behind. I've told him that he's one of the reasons I chose to seek help and stay alive but...he doesn't get it.  


It feels like everyday I have to talk him out of it....And even when I'm crying on my bed over my own worries, I have to hold it back and be strong and comfort him. Even when I've just been from a funeral, if I see him in distress, I need to stop thinking about that and comfort him. Even when I finally get the best news of my life in 2 years...I feel bad for being happy while he's suffering. He keeps telling me that he's not my responsibility...I just want my friend to stay alive. I know he feels the same way about me but he can't seem to understand that that's what I feel about him...I can't help him if he won't help himself...  


I'm so tired...but I can't tell him...I don't want him to feel like a burden. But I feel so powerless...I feel like nothing I do works...I feel like telling him I'm here doesn't seem to work anymore...and I know my presence alone can't help him...but he refuses to eat...refuses to drink his meds...he can't talk to his psyche...he doesn't want other friends...he doesn't want to find better...and he himself has even stated not being interesed at being happy again....I'm so lost...I can't be happy while I watch him suffer...I feel...so...trapped","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
Should I Admit Myself to a Mental Hospital?,"19, male, if that helps any. For the past three or four years I've been struggling with major depressive spells but this most recent one has been going on since March of last year and it's really taking its toll. I'm living with my abusive parents who constantly remind me of how shitty I am, college is a no-go because of my finances and performance in high school, and I don't really have an outlet to find friends. None of the people I have in my life seem to care at all about my mental or physical health and only want me around when they're feeling down or lonely.

I remember how being happy felt and I want that again but I don't have insurance nor the money for medicine.

"I feel like I don't deserve to be sad, but I am.","I understand this may seem silly. Everyone has their own issues and struggles, their own obstacles and problems, etc. But I truly have a very blessed life, I am attending college, living with my father; he and his wife have very respectable income. I do not have to pay rent, I have an abundance of friends who care about me a lot, I have hobbies that I excel in, I am at least relatively proactive in taking care of myself (eating breakfast, lunch dinner, exercise, etc.), I don't partake in self-destructive behaviors (examples: smoking, drinking, etc.)  


So why do I feel sad? More importantly, why do I feel GUILTY for feeling sad? I look around and see people in situations light years worse than mine, and that is a big part of why I find it so hard to talk about this. I start to feel down and I want to speak up but my ""down"" is just the majority of the norm for some people, and I feel like I am unable to be taken seriously because of this.  


But even more than just worrying that other people will not take me seriously, I feel like I can not take myself seriously, and it feels beyond pathetic. I hate myself so much when I watch people in terrible situations still trying their best to do the best for themselves and others around them. I feel like I have such a golden opportunity at life yet I'm just wasting it in self sorrow and self pity. This realization has pushed me to an extent. Like I said, I have hobbies that I excel in, I go running and try to take care of myself the best I can. I do my best to help around when I can, be a contributing member of communities and generally just be nice. Yet I still find myself feeling like it's not enough and that I'm just not worth it. How am I supposed to work on my problems when I don't even know what they are anymore?  


I'm at a very low point in my life. I manage to put on a strong-front for my friends and family, and don't get me wrong, I am truly happy on a respectable amount of days. But the growing strength and quantity of my closer-to-suicidal nights are very clearly alarming. Even the thought of that is riddled with guilt (But that's nothing new).

I’m not asking for pity so please I don’t want any.
I currently live alone with my kitten Leo. I have social anxiety, depression, ptsd, and I’m just all screwed up in the head. I stopped taking medicine because it made me feel like a zombie and constantly made me sick.
I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not happy with my job, where I live, how I look, the fact that I’m inside every second I’m not working. I just don’t know what to do. I’ve never actually heard of any success stories, and I am starting to believe they don’t exist.
If you have a success story I’d love to hear it, or even just some advice I’d love to hear it.

My boyfriends depression,"So my boyfriend told me that he was in a bad place before he met me &amp; that nowadays (the entirety of being with me) he’s been happy &amp; hasn’t felt sad in a minute. Today somehow the topic of being sad came up &amp; I was like “why would you be sad again?” &amp; he responded with “because it always relapses. That’s how depression works.” &amp; I was speechless.

Hi, I'm almost 18 years old, and I'm trying to briefly summarize my life as fast as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been bullied at school since I was around 9 years old (fourth grade). It got a little less in eighth grade, but most of the people at school still left me out. (had about 2 relatively good friends). At the same time (about 14/15 years old I started drinking. I came to school drunk about 2-3 times a week and drank now and then on weekends. (Mostly I drank alone. I hated going to school because of the other students and tried to make my time there a little nicer.

At the same time I got to know a very good friend to whom I could open up for the first time because she also had to struggle with bullying and depression. However, I fell deeply in love with her but never told her and always pretended I just wanted to be friends with her because she was my only good friend and I didn't want to lose her. I became emotionally dependent on her.

After a little over 2 years she began to feel that I felt for her (she had a boyfriend at the time). We fell out and she cut off contact with me. I was devastated for months, unable to concentrate on work and just plain desperate. It was two years ago and I still have to think about her quite a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

In the period between 14 years old (eighth grade) and now (almost 18) a lot more things happened.

My sister had to move out because she made my mother mentally broken, I had alcohol poisoning at school, we had a stepfather who made me and my mother mentally broken (my mother had to go to the psychiatric hospital for a few months),  i almost had to go to the children's home (which would probably have been a good decision) and some more stuff which i cant talk about in detail cause it would take way to long.

Now to the current situation. Lately (since about 8 months)  I have a lot of worries and fears about my life. I often think that my life is worthless and that i did and do everything wrong. I have strong emotional fluctuations during the day but i never show them to my surroundings. Many praise me for being such a calm guy and always having everything ""under control""

I actually do almost no sport anymore (that was one of only things that I enjoyed. I have no structure in my daily routine. On my days off, I sometimes lie around for hours on my bed and just think about it all the mistakes i have made and all the bad things that have happened. I dont really enjoy anything anymore beside listening to music or playing video games. I almost no longer write to my friends, sometimes only reply to messages after a few days or ignore them completely.

I've had suicidal thoughts for a few years now and then, but I couldn't do it to my mother / family because my mother would probably die from the loss and she means everything for me. I never harmed myself.

I never opend up to anyone except my ex-best friend i wrote about ↑ and this subreddit rn. I never spoke to a professional therapist or something like that, but I think it's about time, since all of this is a heavy burden and I just can't find a way out.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
I hit an all time low today,"I made plans to end it all today. I was so sad. Then my mom came home and asked me if I wanted dinner. I rejected and then went in the kitchen and ate it anyways. She was on the sofa so I kinda just rested my head against her side and drank some green tea. It helped calm me down. 

Before she came home, I was on my bed all day. And I kept getting good sleep even without doing anything. Im realizing im mentally tired. 

I realized I don’t need to kill myself because I am already dead. Her being home made me feel neutral rather than sad so it felt like a huge shift. I feel like I need to go on depression meds.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1
"I think a friend may have done something bad, what can I do?","Hi,

I'm not really sure where else to go with this, a friend of mine has kinda just disappeared for over a day now and usually when this happens they're active \*somewhere\* still. This time, they've had no online activity for the entire time, and its honestly got me really worried cause I cant get in contact and they were in a really bad mood the last time I heard from them. I'm kinda assuming the worst right now sadly as thats what my brain does - i left so much unsaid and it's gonna pain me for the rest of my life if i'm correct - but what should I do? what can I do? they live like 100 miles away so its not like i can go find them...

I don't know how to be normal,I realize that no one is happy all the time. I know happiness is not a base state of being.

32 yo loser story,"Hi friends.. this is my very first post here..  
I have 32, I have been ancomputer science engineer for 2 years but I have not practiced the profession .

I think that I'm a loser.  
I've always tought I'm usless. I think that I have depression from 12 or 13 years old.  
I'm feel alone... I feel fat, ugly, alone. I was bullied at school for years.  
I think that I hate myself.

  
I live with my parents. my mom has a respiratory disease an my dad is alcoholic.   
With the passage of time, I have lost all my interests, from music (I play guitar), computers, video games, reading. etc.

I have been single for 1 year in a relationship of 2 months. I fell in love and she left me.   
I feel that I'm not enough for any type of relationship. I have no real friends. The only thing that unites me to this world is a beautiful dog.

I'm scared, lately I just think about hurting myself, cutting myself again or taking a rope and ending it all at once. I had treatment for 2 years with prozac and I feel that it never influenced me.

 I have tried to change my life but sooner or later I lose all motivation and abandon all expectations to improve, I feel that I simply cannot improve my life

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep going,"I posted yesterday, but things keep getting worse.

So my spouse and I were given a 30 day move out notice because our depression mess was too much for them. It’s not even that’s bad, and we’ve been actively trying to get better, but they wouldn’t work with us at all.

My spouse called her mom today to wish her a happy birthday and her mom ended up asking a bunch of questions about our plan and what we’re doing, and my fiancée broached the subject of her possibly taking our cats. Her mom proceeded to freak out at her and say that she was being disrespectful and then yelled at my spouse for being manipulative when she started to cry. She then said that if we really can’t find anything that we can move in with her, but obviously that’s not something that any of us want. 

My spouse is currently sobbing in the bathroom, barely able to move, and I just feel so utterly fucking helpless and afraid. She told me that she wants to kill herself so fucking bad but that she can’t because that would be unfair to me. I worry every fucking day that this will be the day that her will to live outweighs that guilt she feels for leaving me. I have for a long time. I used to come home when I worked an earlier shift from her and check the closet to make sure I didn’t find her hanging there, and that was even when things were going relatively okay.

I don’t know how we’re supposed to do this. How do we get an apartment if we’re being kicked out in the middle of our lease? No one will want us with this on our record. I’m terrified of if we have to go to her mom’s. I would suggest that just she move back in (because I think part of her mom’s issue is with me) and I find a couch to crash on until we can figure it out, but I worry that her mental state would get worse being at her mom’s without me, dealing with her mother’s emotional abuse every day.

I’m terrified. I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. My spouse’s mental health is so much worse than mine so I’m the one who always has to be strong and supportive, but I’m losing it. I’m losing my grip on things. I don’t have anyone to go to. I don’t really have many friends because my depression worsened after college and I lost touch with almost everyone I was close to.

Don't know what to do...,"I'm 20 years old...since two years the most time of my life I spend in my bedroom. 
1 friend, 2 people of my family died. I got addicted to benzodiazepines and went to a rehabilitation hospital...but because of the lockdown nothing changed. My family live in another city and so many friends left me, I feel alone but with the time it feels good. I'm also bisexual, I know that since I'm 13 but never talked about that with anyone. (Only to my therapist)  now the second lockdown ist here in germany, sitting here and accepting every day that it's okay to die alone or stay my howl life alone....
I dont know....after one year staying in my thoughts and got also back to benzodiazepines now... 
Is this all? Is this the sense of my life? What will happen after death? I don't feel like anyone would care about me (I tried to kill myself once) 
My anxiety got so bad, I'm always paranoid and hate myself because I'm skinny. That's why I would never let anyone touch me or things like sexual, because of my shame for my own body. I'm going only outside when I'm going to eat something or when it's dark and not that much people there because I think there would always say things about me because I feel like shit. (Even when I know they don't, its unnerving. ) 
Also after that long time here alone I dont wanna do anything anymore, I feel disconnected from the world, playing computer games and drinking wine. 
I hate this society, the people who life that ""normal"" life and I hate me, at some point i think like:""Why? Why I can't be normal like them...)

Help finding therapist,"Hi everyone. First time posting here and looking to see if anyone has any advice. This is not a throw away because I don’t care what people think about me. 

I suffer from highly functional depression. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and am currently on medication, which helps, but still have bad days. I have seen a psychologist in the past, middle aged male, that I couldn’t open up to. After seeing him for 2 years I stopped going because of work change. My spouse, primary care, and psychiatrist all urge me to find someone to talk to. I thought long and hard and realized the personality of someone that I could open up to.

With all this being said, is there a good way to search for local therapists online in your area? I tried a few months back and could only find older individuals. I need someone closer to my age (36) as I feel it would allow me to open up more.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Has anyone ever felt like their brain has shut off?,That’s the best I could describe how I’ve been feeling for almost 2 months. I’m just overwhelmed with everything that’s going on in my life and the world to the point where it’s hard to keep up. I’ve been hearing nothing but negativity that’s been happening in this world and it caused an overload to my brain. It’s been difficult focusing and I’ve been feeling more apathetic. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore. One of the things that helped me cope with my depression has made me lose interest in it. It’s bothering me a lot because it happened so abruptly. Has anyone overcame this? If so how?,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can’t help myself, and there is nowhere to get help.","Things keep getting worse. I am not suicidal, I have always contemplated suicide but I know that I wouldn’t go through with it. Lately I noticed that I have been thinking about it more often though.

I am saying this because I don’t even know if things are actually getting worse. I can’t even allow myself to feel bad because I don’t really know if I’m supposed to feel bad. I’m trying to justify why I think that things are getting worse by saying that I think about suicide more often.

I don’t really know what I’m feeling. I’m feeling something but I don’t know what it is or whether or not I’m supposed to feel it. But I guess I can say that I’m feeling pretty hopeless. I did Beck’s Depression Inventory and it seems like I have moderate depression. Which is not a new thing for me, I’ve had depression for the last 6-7 years. I’m 23 btw. I used a lot of medications, I also went to therapy for about 7-8 months. I can’t go to therapy anymore because I don’t have the money for it. I can’t ask for money from my parents because they need to support my sister who is going to go to uni. There are no free therapists around either.

I also don’t know if I should go to therapy. Am I being selfish? Am I indulging in my thoughts and feelings too much? Other people have problems too, and I would be lying if I said that I have it worse than most people.

I also failed at school. In 6 years I was only able to finish the first years classes.

I am... lazy. Irresponsible. In the past and maybe even right now, I have acted without thinking about others. My parents worked hard to make sure I can get education. I am ashamed of myself for not doing what I needed to do. I am also ashamed of lying to them about my school. They still don’t know that I failed.

I don’t know if I can say that I tried to fix what’s wrong with me. I attempted to get better and fix myself, and every time I tried I failed. I tried understanding why I failed, and I failed at that too.

I also have gender dysphoria. It isn’t bad most of the time, I don’t know if I should try to do something about it, but it hurts me. I came out to my mum and she acted like I killed her son, so I got back into the closet. So I have no idea what to do.

I have a friend, but she is not really in a great place to help me, and since my friend is not my therapist, she can’t help me in a way a therapist might be able to help me.

I tried just ignoring my dysphoria and I guess it works to some extent but it’s not really insignificant. But it’s also not significant enough for me to make up my mind about fixing it. Also my parents are not mentally very stable so if I came out it could financially hurt my sister. Because my dad is the only provider and his mental state is hanging by a thread.

I tried thinking hard about stuff, and I failed. I tried doing stuff but I failed. Let’s say that I failed to try hard enough maybe.

I can’t help myself. I have no hope from the future, everything is going to get worse. I am also sick, some kind of bone marrow disease. One day it may kill me. Doctors aren’t really sure if I have it but they basically treat me like I have it, so it is likely that I have it.

And I have started to notice that I don’t really want to get better. I don’t know what a normal day feels like anymore. I dread the future.

I also noticed that I have an obsession with pain. I noticed that there is not a day that goes by without me thinking about all the horrible things that are happening in the world, all the terrible things that may (and will) happen to me, how I’m hurting my parents by lying to them, how I should be ashamed of myself, and after I go on about this for some time I start to think about how I am selfish for indulging in my own thoughts and problems so much.

I also have IBS. It used to be not very bad but these days I sometimes come very close to having a nervous breakdown because of how much pain it causes. I sometimes take almost freezing showers to stop the pain, because my body goes into “we’re dying mode” and blocks the pain from my bowels.

I feel ashamed of myself. I’m living a better life than 90 percent of the world. I don’t have to worry about food, getting ill, getting killed or not having a shelter. I live in a clean home. I can take a shower whenever I want. Both my parents are still alive and well. But I don’t feel okay. And whining about not feeling okay makes me feel very privileged. But I’m not okay.

I used to be very into electronics. I used to spend a lot of time into mathematics so that I can understand how electronic circuits work. I actually built my first shortwave radio when I was 12. I was dreaming of becoming an electronics engineer. I always had issues with my gender identity, but it used to be not so bad. It’s strange really. Back in the old days, people had a lot of life threatening problems. There were plagues, long and bloody wars, famine etc. I feel very privileged for feeling bad about my issues. And I’m not the only one with these problems, and majority of the people in the world has much bigger problems, I know that. But they still try to keep going, but I can’t keep going. I can’t help myself, I just can’t. There is no one that can help me either, and I feel cornered. I don’t know what to do. My confidence in my ability to make a plan and execute it is completely crushed. I can’t even stop myself from overeating. I lost the control of myself, I am like a train speeding into another train without a brake.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0
Therapist won’t give meds,"I’m a minor with the NHS in the UK. (CAMHS.) 
You’re probably thinking that there must be a reason, no. I’m this close to ending it all and my therapist will just refuse to let me see the psychiatrist no matter how many times I ask. 
If I do attempt it will be successful, so it’s not like I’ll have multiple attempts ie. they may give me meds after one.

What do I say to get them to think more about giving me them? They’re so reluctant. I see people complain 24/7 about how they dish out meds on a platter. But it’s the opposite for me and there is absolutely no reason.

Low-functioning Depression &amp; Exercise,"Ive struggled with depression for quite a while now, and certain times I find motivation comes easier than others. However, for the past three months I have been at a very low point, I shower once a week and I struggle to brush my teeth and hair. That’s where I’m at.

Last July I started seeing a personal trainer for the goal of weight loss and I haven’t seen her for 6 weeks now. My mom is encouraging me to go back, for my mental health’s sake, but right now I have no interest in exercise. Also, I fear that if I go back my goal of weight loss will prioritize over my goal of benefiting my mental health. I know I inevitably kick myself for not going back, but the dread is over powering my rationale. I would prefer to just to 10 minute workouts on my own in my pyjamas, but I know I probably won’t.  Personal training just seems like a lot.

What should I do? If you have been or know someone who is low-functioning, has personal training been helpful? Or exercise in general? Is it better to start small when you’re low functioning or just throw yourself in?

I appreciate any thoughts and advice as really I only have my mom’s perspective right now and she doesn’t totally understand the depressed brain.

"I can’t feel anything, no matter what I do, I can’t feel anything physically or mentally","I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and I’ve recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also can’t feel any pain, some might think it’s a gift but it’s a fucking curse. I’m numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I haven’t eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. I’ve been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and can’t physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. I’d get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her “accidents”. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasn’t scared, or worried, I was calm, and didn’t even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasn’t sad or scared. Ever since then, it’s just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was “ok”. Honestly it was probably best for her, I don’t know if I can feel love anymore, so what’s the point of trying. I recently noticed I can’t physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didn’t feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’d say I’m terrified, but I’m not even sure I can feel terrified anymore. I just need help. I’m sorry for how long this paragraph is.

My motivations in life were to support financially and psychologically my cousin and my single mother friend, first got into a relationship the other leaving country soon and I'm not working to support her. Now the only thing keeping me from taking the exit is to not hurt my mom.

I've been depressed a long time and I'm really struggling right now,"I think I've had depression for my whole life or at least early in my life, I was on the path toward depression. Now I'm an adult and I feel like I'm only getting worse as time goes on. Each time I get low I'm going lower and it's lasting longer. At about the end of the lockdown in my area, I had a breakdown. I had a panic attack that lasted for far too long and then for weeks afterward I would have them multiple times a day and for hours. It's not as bad as that anymore but the anxiety has been worse since then.

 I don't know how to describe the severity of my problem. Examples I guess could be; I quit my job five months ago in large part for my mental health (but also a myriad of other reasons of course) and have not returned to work since. I had an injury that will likely require surgery and I've been avoiding the doctor for going on seven months now and It's getting worse as a result. I also spend most of my days doing mostly nothing but find distractions from doing anything meaningful and have consistently failed to break that pattern. 

I want to live my life and I don't know if I'm qualified to handle this on my own anymore but I don't know what to do. I don't want antidepressants and things like that.

To medicate or not..,"About 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression + anxiety: no biggie. It runs in the family, it's a biological depression as one side of the family doesn't produce enough serotonin, so nothing actually happened to me to set it off.
But it affected a lot of things that I wanted control over, I wasn't living my best life. 
I went on medication (Venlafaxin(effexor)), and it helped dramatically. Though I gained 15kgs in the 6 months.
So I came off. I've been good for 2 years, I got the weight back down, and I'm hovering between average and athletic.
But recent changes in my life have stirred the pot. 
Mirtazapine is a recommendation that *should* work differently and not cause the weight gain. 
I don't want to go on the meds again if I'm going to gain that weight back so fast. I don't want to be on meds my whole life like my family members.
But nor do I want to stay like I am currently.
So how do I decide? Flip a coin? 
My psychologist and psychiatrist haven't been able to help me make my mind up. 

Anybody been on mirtazapine? Does it cause weight gain and kill libido? Not that I have a libido at the moment anyway, thanks life 👍","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

How do you deal with losing all interest in your passions in life?,"A few years ago, a really bad breakup turned into a long term depressive episode, and I lost all interest in the very few passions in life that define me. 
I spend a lot of time really missing being in love with what I used to do the way I previously was-- from time to time I even have the tendency to try to push myself into giving it another spin. But every time I try, it feels like a job, and all motivation and determination I have gets sucked straight out of me. 
I just want to love doing music again, because I've been such a bland, shell of a person since I suddenly fell out of it.

Letting my boyfriend commit suicide. Please help.,"Throwaway because he knows my main.

My boyfriend wants more than anything to commit suicide. I've never met someone so sure of anything before. It comes off that way at least. It's not a cry for help, it's not for attention, and it's not a bluff. I'm 100% positive. I try to offer support, solutions, and my love but it makes no difference.

I know I have to respect his wishes because ultimately we're both pro-choice, and I don't want him in pain anymore. I can't handle this reality though. I'm in so much pain, and I don't have any support. I love him so much. He says that if I love him, I'll let him go...

Please help me...please. 

I've had 24/7 derealization for 4 years now. I also have BPD. I cannot process the my emotions when I think about him dying or when we are talking about it (I'm the one who asks to talk about it -especially if he says something like ""I despise life"" or ""I just want to be done"" while he's frustrated - and he reluctantly does just a little bit). I go into a very confused state (really, I feel a level of confusion most all of the time) where my feelings are so overwhelming that I feel like I need to claw my brain out or just hang myself right there. I try not to show this in front of him, but I have had some horrible panic attacks after our conversations. I know this just stresses him out more, and I feel awful about it. 

I have a SEVERE death phobia. It's always on my mind, and it makes it extremely hard to function day-to-day. I have constant intrusive thoughts about bad afterlife scenarios. I guess it may be partly OCD.  When I think about him being dead I get so many instrusive thoughts about him not being okay if there is an afterlife - that he's lonely, scared, or in more pain that he was here. As illogical as it may be, I think about how he might be scared, experiencing regret, or in pain in his last moments - I think about how that will lie with him forever and he'll never get to know that he is finally okay. I know it probably sounds extremely dumb. He says he's not scared of death, and that helps me slightly.

I'm in so much pain now, and I'm scared of how much pain is to come. I think about the moment I find out that he's dead and how I'll just want to scream at the top of my lungs. I've been suicidal myself for years now and I think this is what will push me over the edge. I'm scared of that. 

I love him. He's my best friend, and I wanted to spend my life with him. He's lying in the other room right now, and I don't know how to manage when the day comes where I can no longer go and lie next to him and give him a cuddle. I'm terrified if forgetting him. I'm trying to make mental notes of his features, and smells, and little things he does. Unfortunately, derealization has made my memory very poor. We're long distance, and have had very little time together in person. I'm from the US and he's from the UK. I don't think I'll be able to attend his funeral because I won't be able to afford to travel, and covid might not allow it anyway. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to step foot in the UK again. 

About him: He's mid 30's. He's been on disability his entire adult life. Being dependent on the government for money and housing is one reason he feels hopeless. He believes he's locked out of ever getting a decent job now and doesn't think he'd be able to cope with one anyway. He doesn't like his living situation. He's very pessimistic and misanthropic. He thinks he may be in the autism spectrum. He thinks he's incompetent and useless. He thinks he's very ugly (I think he has BDD because I have it myself). The biggest issue is probably his OCD. He has severe contamination OCD, and it's what he's in disability for. He says OCD is hell. One big example - He lived in a flat with Artex ceilings most of his adult life (moved now) and he believes hes been exposed to a lot of asbestos. He wants to end his life before lung cancer sets in. He is scared of aging and his body and mind deteriorating, getting diseases or becoming disabled and reliant on others for care. He resents this is the way things are and wants to end his life before nature can take it's course. He resents life. I sympathize with all of these things and relate to many. 

The NHS has failed him. There seems to be no good help within his options. He's so pessimistic about healthcare workers now that he doesn't want to try.

He plans on committing suicide before summer because he thinks this flat is going to get unbearably hot. It's on the 3rd/top floor. His OCD won't allow him to use a fan because he's scared of fibers flying around, and no coolers involving water because he's worried about mold. He doesn't think a portable a/c unit will be able to cool the flat down enough and that it will be very expensive. I can't personally think of another solution for the heat.

I want him to know happiness, but it doesn't seem possible. I feel awful that he's stuck around for my sake. He's missed out on sourcing the best drug for suicide now that UK customs are more strict since early January. He doesn't blame me, but it is my fault, and I really won't ever be able to forgive myself for it. Really, I do think he resents me. 

I don't know how to cope or how to go on myself. I need help, and I don't have anywhere to get it. Nothing makes any of this okay or better. I feel like a sitting duck. I can't function and I haven't been for well over a year now. I tell him that I love him and that I'll always be here for him to fight with him through anything. It makes no difference.

Why did my poor baby have to experience all of this?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

I really want that but the thought of it scares me insanely much.

Right now, the only thing bringing me joy is spending time with my boyfriend online. We’ve been together for a year now and it couldn’t be more perfect, except my disorder ruining a lot of things. I play games with him online, we have so much fun. I don’t want to lose that. Additionally I am studying and I’d be done next year and graduate. However without some kind of help I know I won’t be able to do it. I already had to repeat a whole year because of my issues.

I don’t know what to do. I really want to be somewhere where I am being watched so I can get help anytime I need it. But I have so much to lose. My partner, my dog, my computer, what if they even take my phone?

I started writing this to calm down from another panic attack over something super small and it helped me calm down but I rarely have something to make me calm again so all I usually do is scream and cry and hurt myself for two hours till my body is too tired to even stay awake so I basically just pass out...

Requesting advice on how to (better) handle a depressive episode,"For me, some times it's triggered by something like a bad day at work or even just out of nowhere. It always winds up the same way. I lose focus on whatever I'm doing, procrastinate, eat whatever junk food I have on-hand, then I wind up talking and screaming at myself as my mind feels like it turned against me. 

I feel ""better"" at the end of it but surely there have to be better ways of handling when these episodes strike? Comfort food and distractions like video games and watching youtube and twitch aren't really cutting it anymore. All advice is appreciated.

I don't know what else to title this... depressed 🤷‍♀️,"Just got off the phone with my mom. She said I sounded insane. At first I was talking a mile a minute, then I was crying, then angry. 
I feel out of wack. 

I've had depression before but covid is definitely making it way worse. I'm a substitute teacher/recent graduate. I don't have any jobs because teachers have been online where I am so I currently have zero income. I can barely afford to live. I don't have any good friends. My 2 best friends live in another city and they tend to screen my calls. Just out of a selfish lack of desire to talk to me. They have boyfriends and babies so they don't need me like I need them. 
I've been so lonely. 
I was dumped back in November. Thought about dating again over Christmas. Met someone nice but I'm so bipolar (maybe clinically, I've had my suspicions) right now that I'm not even a healthy person to date. One second I'm seizing the day, full face of makeup, exercising and ready for a date, the next second I'm canceling, crying, laying in bed watching movies and hating myself like an empty shell. 

Before you say get therapy or look into being diagnosed with bipolar, the reason I don't is 1. Can't afford therapy and 2. Because of everything with covid, being dumped, having no income, having no friends, I truly do think this could just be a situational depression with manic tendencies due to boredom. 
I don't know what to do though. 
My mom said ""go date to make friends"" - that's not how dating works. Then she told me to move home, well I don't wanna be stuck with my family like a 25 year old loser. I just wish my life was better, I want to be living it instead of crying. 

Could use some support or advice or even just be listened to since noone else does.

Having no money is a huge source of depression and I hate it when people try to convince me otherwise,"It's not about not being able to afford stuff for yourself, it's about not feeling safe, not knowing if you'll afford to live and always having weight on your shoulders.

Is There a Depression Retreat Like This?,"Imagine if you're depressed, and are too broke to take care of yourself financially, where do you turn to? Free therapy is one way if you have that around you. 

But how about this?-what if someone were to bring all the depressed people together and have them grow plants or something? 

That way, the person bringing them all together get to sell those fruits and veggies that grew and make a quick buck while these depressed people get exposure to nature as well as have a social bond?

Does anything like this exist? Because I'm too tired and too broke to pull this off but please tell me someone has so that I can be a part of something like this and get better.

There are also stupid rules like at lunch no tv, only homework. My parents want me to do exercise but I am already 6ft1 and 150 pounds. They scream at me when I want to use my 30 mins of screen time after I have done my homework. On weekends I sleep for 14+ hours and I just feel like I am in a constant cycle of screaming and pain.

I’m starting to have a harder time functioning,"Hey, I’m a 19 y/o male (20 on Easter. Thought that would be a fun thing to throw in) and I’ve been living with depression since I was 9 or 10. It’s just progressed as I’ve gone on. I’ve always been an extremely self loathing person and the negative thoughts just come up more frequently. It just happens out of nowhere. Doesn’t matter what I’m doing, it’ll just sucker punch me. My mood gets really dark at the snap of a finger. 

But now it’s getting harder to actually cope with it and function as a human being. I think it’s been this way for about a year now. I used to be able to escape it if I was doing something active. Like with friends or whatever. But now it doesn’t matter. It’ll just fuck me up whenever. Sometimes it can get to the point where I’ll have difficulty remembering things or having a conversation, I don’t know how to formulate sentences, and it just becomes all-consuming. I don’t understand it.

My thoughts in this state range from craving substances to escape, thoughts about how nobody likes me and I don’t matter to anyone, and sometimes thoughts that I need to hang myself. I want to have a good life but I don’t want to live it as me. I’m way too hard on myself. I know I have a charismatic personality that some people enjoy, and I can acknowledge some of my strengths when I’m more level headed, but more and more I just regress to what I described earlier where my mind just tries to take me down.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Never had anywhere near the success I want in life,"I (25m) am currently unemployed. I've really struggled to make friends (I have a few now) or date anyone in life.

Severe seasonal affective disorder,"I [28M] live in Canada and I’ve had SAD since i’ve ever known. Was originally born in a very warm country and migrated here when I was 6.

In the summers, I feel so fucking amazing. Any obstacle thrown at me I have no issue combating and honestly fear no issue. My eyes are lit up awake every waking hour, I sleep well and even if i get 5 hours of sleep. It’s fine and I keep pushing forward.

However in winter, it’s the exact opposite. I feel like crying when a small problem occurs at work, my brain feels frozen and i can’t even concentrate on a show even if I’ve slept a full 8 hours. Sometimes i feel like I can’t breathe. I do take 2000 iu of vitamin D as recommended by my doc but doesnt seem to help. But, if there is a bright sunny day like today, I feel great again.

Because of this, it feels like I continously move forward in summer and my relationships with people are great. However i take steps back every winter so my relationships and friendships always take a hit. Also because of this it’s hard for me to advance in my career as well as I have a hard time remembering anything or staying focused in the winter. My SAD gets so bad that thoughts of suicide enters my mind in the winter.

Please Help: Spontaneous Suicide Attempts - 25 y/o Female,"My wife (25 year old female) whom I've been with for 8 years, recently attempted taking her own life for the third time. I was lucky enough to notice something was up, and prevent the act. When she isn't in a depressed state, she is smiley, friendly and she even manages to excel as a grad student at a top school. She has been battling with bouts of severe depression and suicidal ideation for her entire life. These depressive episodes never seem to correspond to events, but come on spontaneously. I think it's also worth noting that her biological aunt committed suicide when she was in her 30s and it was also unexpected and didn't seem to be related to any specific occurance.   


The first time my wife attempted suicide was in college. A friend called 911 and she was briefly evaluated at the ER and then released (I think she lied about her real feelings). A few years later, she suddenly told me one day that she felt she needed to be admitted immediately for her own safety, and I drove her to the hospital where she voluntarily was admitted for about a week, and was finally set up with a psychiatrist. This is where things got a little bit better for awhile: the psychiatrist prescribed some medications that really seemed to help, a lot. She seemed to get down less frequently, and she said that her depression was more mild and less frequent. She also said that the ""voice that tells her to harm herself"" was far less common.

Her medications have been adjusted a bit over the course of a couple years (I've included the current medication regimen below), but unfortunately things are still far from alright. While her depressive episodes seem to be less common, she still has occasional, spontaneous serious suicidal ideation. Recently, she made an attempt in the middle of the afternoon that I was able to stop, and by that night she was smiley, laughing and back to her normal self.

This latest attempt has made me realize that we are not out of the woods, and she needs more aggressive/serious care if she is going to survive. I asked her if she was fully honest with her psychiatrist about her suicide attempts and her ideation, and she admitted that she has downplayed it. I told her that my dream is simply to grow old together, and that I would fight for her life with everything I have. I suggested that she schedule an emergency appointment with her psychiatrist to discuss her recent attempt, to be transparent about her actual ideation, and to push for more serious treatment, as her (and my) life truly depend on this. I also asked to join the meeting to provide my observations and ensure that the seriousness is truly conveyed (she can be so friendly that she downplays negative things).

She was totally open to this, and agreed that she needs to push for more serious treatment, since it is truly life or death. I am usually the one who steps in when some tough pushing/advocacy needs to be done, and I am now here to step up. This has become the most important thing in my life, and I am on a search for a solution. I just want her to survive, to live a peaceful, happy life, and I want to be there with her, until we get old. I know that the psychiatrist may have the answers, but this is too serious to put our lives in a single person's hands. I'm begging you to please consider this, and to please make some suggestions about treatments we should raise with the doctor, or if there are certain doctors you think we should seek out. Is electroshock therapy something we should bring up, for example? I'm fighting for her life, and will do anything to save her. She wants to be better, and is open to whatever is needed. Thank you for your time.

I feel depressed but feel like even more of a loser for feeling depressed.,"This might not resonate at all with some people. It’s always been hard to explain. I’ve never actually told anyone in this level of detail before. 

I have this overwhelming notion that i’m a loser. It always in the back of my mind but often times it’ll just overcome me a little bit. I struggle pretty occasionally with depression. Had about a year and a half in high school where it was really bad, never told anyone. Off and on in college, never told anyone. Overall I know a lot of people struggle with depression and many very likely have it much worse than me. Given that, I always felt the need to “suck it up” and control my attitude. Sometimes i think i do a pretty good job of it honestly. “Pushing on” and such. I’ve always been able to put on a face paired with the fact that i’ve never given off the presentation of someone who is struggling deep down.

I’ll get to one thing that I think complicates things at least for me. I come from a really rich family. Pretty much a carbon copy of the “daddy’s money type” although one of the very few personal attributes i’ve been able to take pride in is my personality doesn’t reflect it. I would say the fact that i’m an only child makes it even more surprising. As i’ve gotten older i’ve gotten much more grateful for how my parents have raised me in that sense. I graduated from college last May with a business degree (that my parents paid for, of course). I have a stable job and i have a really great group of friends, most of which are elsewhere now for their jobs/school. 

I’ve never *really* accomplished anything in life. I’ve always felt like kind of a loser since high school. I was an average student. Pretty bad at sports even though I dedicated a pretty huge part of life to them at one point. I went to college far away. I graduated and went home and couldn’t find a job in my field at all. I have a stable job now, albeit not something i wanted to do nor do i enjoy. Everything good i’ve ever had in life (including that job, and basically all other jobs i’ve had) is pretty much because of my dad and my last name. All of my friends who started off with so much less and dealt with more pressing issues in life went on to do so much more. I feel pretty much hopeless in finding something that i really want to do or because i’m not like them. I’m definitely not the smart one or the good looking one or the outgoing/funny one. Im the only one whose never really had a girlfriend. I’m pretty much just the rich one who at the time was a “pity friend” of a few guys i knew my entire life and grew up with but a lot of the people I came across in both high school and college never really liked me, not because i was an ass (i’m relatively quiet), but because i never fit into a lot of those circles because of this or that yet because my childhood friends *were* friends with those guys, i was kind of just a fringe guy to them and still am now that i’m home. Sometimes i think i put myself in the wrong groups of people in life because i didn’t have the social skills to find my own.

This whole idea of me not being good at anything worthwhile has really carried into my early adult life. It’s to a point now where i’m afraid of failure more than anything. I’m afraid of a lot. I’ve been feeling depressed off and on since about July on this go around. I get discouraged probably way too easily. I also feel like a disappointment. I’m afraid of telling people that i’m depressed or that i have struggled with depression in the past. It would disappoint my parents because they’ve given me so much. It makes me feel pathetic that i’m depressed because of everything i was born into. Sometimes i would fight the notion that what i was feeling was actually depression given my situation, but that was always redirected to me just being “soft” or a “pussy” in my mind that made me feel even worse. Sympathy always makes me feel guilty, really no matter what it’s about. It’s been a cycle i’ve dealt with for years now and i don’t know that it’s even boiling over into anything harmful to me on the outside but i’m tired of it bringing me down. Part of why it’s hard to talk about is because i can only imagine the eye rolls when hearing about some rich kid complain that he’s “struggling” when people are probably in 10x worse situations than me. I get it. But I figured reddit is anonymous so if people think i’m a loser then who cares. I think if i told most people what i’m going through they would just say i’m an overworrier and overthinking, but at this point i’m tired of life just sucking. I’m tired of relative failure my whole life. And like i said i’m tired of only being “so” good at putting negative thoughts about myself in the backburner and not allowing them back into my usual frame of mind. They just never fail to come back and haunt me. The only way i can continue push forward is to find some self worth. I don’t even know why i came to this sub. I just thought about it and felt like it was an opportunity to let out some emotions that i’ve been holding for a long time now. Maybe as an opportunity to learn more about it because of my long reluctancy to ever face my depression head on and always dance around it and pretend to not let it affect me unless i’m in an environment where it’s safe to do so, which is just by myself. 

Thanks to anyone with any kind of insight, positive *or* negative. I’ve tried to always be a realist with myself despite my issues in conjuring up some sense of self worth.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I thought it would go away,"I’ve been depressed since childhood. It was really rough growing up and I had a hard start. I pushed through so much and was finally able to get my degree and a great job. I make more money than I need, and I came from living in my car. I finally have all my “ducks in a row” and yet here is my depression. 

Almost three years ago I got put on 300mg Wellbutrin XL. For the first time in my life I felt what it was like to walk around without the lead weight in my chest. About eight months in, the meds stopped working and I had one of the worst depressive episodes of my life. They bumped me to 450mg which is the absolute max dose. It’s been a couple years since then and I’m worried the medication has once again stopped working. 

I’m  a 30 year old woman and I’m feeling defeated by this thing. Is the rest of my life just me repeatedly defeating and beating down my depression? I think about having kids but I always think it would be so unfair for them to have me as a mother. What if I reach a point I can’t take it anymore and I really do and up “ending it”. How could I leave children that way? 

I guess I’m spiraling here. Just crying for no reason for the first time in so long and I know what’s coming for me if I don’t address it immediately. I thought if I got my life in order the depression would go away. Can anyone relate? How do you deal with life long symptoms?

"Lost motivation, want to quit... please help","Fourth-year med student currently in the midst of clinicals. Just can't find the motivation to study or attend online tutorials or go for wards anymore.

I feel so tired everyday, sometimes I wish I would just die in my sleep &amp; not wake up the next morning. Nowadays, whenever I try to study or listen to the online lectures, either my head feels like it's in a haze &amp; nothing goes in, or I get palpitations, breathlessness &amp; feel like puking. &amp; in the wards, I feel totally dissociated from what's going on during rounds. I'm so sick the endless cycle of trying to complete anki reviews &amp; revise my notes, in addition to having to cram in new information that the doctors in the wards quiz us on &amp; say we ""must know otherwise we'll fail the exams"". Yet, whenever I try to take a break, I feel even more anxious &amp; guilty for ""slacking"", &amp; can't enjoy any of the hobbies I used to like. My insomnia has been getting worse &amp; worse, &amp; the times that I'm finally so tired that I crash, I don't wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. I seriously dk how my classmates manage to stay so enthusiastic about medicine &amp; how they have the stamina to constantly discuss study-related things/meet up for practice all the time.

Also, I'm so scared I'll turn into a monster/ lose my sense of humanity because it hasn't even been 2 years into clinicals yet &amp; already, I feel numb to patients' stories like every other history I take has been reduced to symptom complex -&gt; diagnosis -&gt; investigations -&gt; management plan. It's so disillusioning to see the doctors in the hospital so jaded &amp; overworked that over time, the focus just becomes discharging patients as fast as possible &amp; documenting changes on computers wheeled around the wards to protect against legal liability. Some of them even talk demeaningly/make snark comments about patients behind their backs, &amp; while I don't expect doctors to be saints, especially given the tough working conditions, it really makes me question my decision to join med school. Because I want to help people but this isn't the way I envision/want myself to be when I graduate. &amp; I've realized over the years that there are so many other ways to help people besides the conventional path glorified by Asian society of ""becoming a doctor &amp; saving lives"" (which is limited by manpower &amp; the time crunch &amp; bureaucracy so in the end, how much can you really help?).

I've tried seeking mental health help from a psychiatrist &amp; was diagnosed with dysthymia + panic attacks, but the meds don't help as my symptoms are precipitated by the med school environment &amp; its associated stress. I've contemplated quitting med school but I'm trapped by the bond/debt. I've considered talking to my school about my struggles but... let's just say that the way doctors talk about mental health behind patients' backs doesn't paint a very encouraging picture for me to open up to them. I've even expressed my thoughts on leaving medicine to my parents &amp; while they are understanding &amp; came around after a tearful session of confessions &amp; explanations, they don't quite get the amount of mental pain I'm in &amp; keep advising me to at least complete school &amp; get my medical degree before leaving. I know that logically, this is the wisest option as there's only about 1+ more year to go... but emotionally &amp; psychology, I'm at a loss as to how to get through 12+ more months packed with lessons &amp; ward rounds &amp; performance assessments &amp; two more big exams.

Girlfriend started taking antidepressants and pushing me away,"Hi (24 M)my gf of 4 years (22F) has - I believe- been struggling with various degrees of depression for a very llong time (probably since before i met her) but she only recently (1 week) started to get some medical help.

I now feel shitty about it because i know she is struggling but at the same time I won't be treated like a carpet.It's important to know we live close by but I've been out of the country for almost 2 months now so we haven't seen each other in a while ( I should return in a few weeks).

I don't know how to help her. I told her to ""hold on"" until the meds can help her but I am at my wit's end, feeling like I am losing her. Help me to help her please  


Edit: the medication is called citalopram","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
How do I start things and stay motivated again?,"I seem to be in a depression hole of a cycle.

I can somehow still manage to go to college 5 days a week, and go to work on weekends.

But once I'm home, I'm utterly depressed, because I have nothing to do. I have hobbies I used to love, but at this point, starting to do something-- anything at all-- seems like a tall hill to climb.
So I just nap and browse the internet/social media. Because that doesn't require effort. 

I used to have passions, like art and music. I used to write, draw, sew, exercise, watch tv, watch movies, and read.

I can't seem to focus properly. I'll be trying to read something, but don't understand what's going on. I can't remember anything, either.

I can't wake up in the morning. 

I tried antidepressant medication, but they actually make me 100x worse.

So now, I need to find natural ways to get up, do things, find passion. I'd like to have a schedule, but every time I try to make a schedule, I can't stick to it. Something is wrong, and I don't know how to fix it or balance myself.

Someone could tell me, ""Just do it"". But that isn't going to help, because there's an important piece of the puzzle missing for me to ""just do it"". I'm not sure why I am this way now.

Any advice?

"Nothing, and I mean NOTHING helps","Do you know what’s worse than being depressed and not having your life in order? Being depressed and having your life in order, because if your life is already in order, there is nothing you can improve on and nothing you can do to try and get better; meaning there is no hope. 

My life used to be a mess, but at least I had something to fall back onto. When I told people about my depression, they told me about all the things that helped them out; like exercising, extracurricular activities, going out with friends, having good grades, eating well, etc. As someone that couldn’t even get out of bed to take a shit, I listened to what everyone told me and did it all. I became an A+ student-athlete, I’m not too good socially but I have a few friends that I talk to and occasionally hang out with, and I lost a lot of weight, but the entire time, I couldn’t shake this feeling that everything was off. 

Theoretically, I should be happy right now, I have become something that I thought was impossible 2 years ago, but it has become clear by now that no matter what I do, I will still want to kill myself. I mean, I feel the same, if not worse than I did 2 years ago. I still stare at my dad’s pistol every time I walk past it in its case, I still think about cutting myself every time I see a blade. 

One single thing I’ve noticed that has been with me since I was like 7, is that the thought of death is the only thing that brings me comfort in tough times. At this point, I feel like it won’t be too long until that thought finally becomes reality.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

I think I messed up trying to make sure my kids had a different childhood than i did.,"Sorry for the rant and sorry for the grammar, I feel like I just hit a damn wall !

I have 3 kids I grew up in a toxic family mom and dad divorced, seen my dad get locked up a lot my mom never being around because she worked so much. 

I always wanted my kids to have a better life than me, you know the American dream mom and dad that stayed together. I didn’t want them becoming a statistic, I guess the toxic thing never went away. My husband and I have known each other since 1999, his dad died in March of 99 and my dad April of 98 we did a lot of stupid shit drugs and staying drunk and all kinds of dumb stuff. We broke up right after he turned 21 because he didn’t want me in his life, I caught him cheating. Well a drunken booty call in October I ended up pregnant, I was happy and we “ tried “ to work it out, he left me high and dry for most of my pregnancy and the first 2 years of our sons life. Toxic family told him I was sleeping with everything that had a penis so our son wasn’t his, his mom paid for a paternity test came back he is 99.9999999% the father ( duh I knew that). Stupid me went back again to him, we moved in together he lied to me every chance we are very toxic for each other. We got married in 2006 had a kid 2007, from 2007 till 2011-2012 something like that he cheated again and made me feel like it was my fault, he lied to me about everything! But he promised he’d be better and he was always sooo very sorry. Fast Forward a couple years his best friends dad died when I was going to leave him and take the kids, he begged me to stay I stayed. We hand another kid 2015 so I figured that was a sign telling me to stay things would get better. But all the things that could go wrong went wrong more lies, we lost our house our car and everything. He sucked at money he would spend spend spend stuff got cut off left and right got into them payday loan shit. Like I couldn’t trust a single word that came out of his mouth but i still stayed thinking it was what’s best for our kids. Fast forward to now 2021 we have 3 kids 1 son and 2 daughters. Our son graduated and works and pays his part of the insurance and the WiFi cause I said if we were getting the highest one he’d have to pay it. And he does he pays his part of insurance and the WiFi no questions asked. My husband is so hard on him every time he says he wants to get a new car or something he bitches cause he sleeps all day when he’s not at work unless he has something to do then he’ll get up and go do it. Our son is more responsible now than My husbands ever been in his 40 years of life. 

My son has anger issues and depression, yeah he got all that from me cause I’m super fucked up! My husband doesn’t think depression is real he says you just snap your self
Out of it. My son came to me yesterday soooo mad at his dad because his dad was bitching about anything and everything he wanted to do. Our son was super sick last week ( tested negative for covid) he was in bed all week. My husband has been using my car to go to work and the battery was bad so he was jumping it every morning with our sons car. Yesterday when our son went to work his car was making noises like the battery was messed up or he needs a new alternator ( he loves cars so he knows what the sounds mean lol)  I think my husband got defensive about it and was like well I didn’t do it ( my husband has totally messed up every single car we’ve owned and totaled my sons other car right before we moved and he doesn’t take any responsibility for any of it it’s always someone else’s fault or he says sorry and it’s never to be spoken of again that’s been our whole relationship) 

Anyway sorry my son came to me yesterday and was like why does dad make me feel like every time I wanna do something for myself I’m lazy or I’m not responsible enough. I told him I was sorry and I didn’t know but maybe it was because my son is more responsible than my husband has EVER been ! Then my son tells me and this isn’t the first time that he’s afraid to move out because he’s worried my husband will get us in another fucking money bind and he’s worried about his sisters. My heart doesn’t know what to feel I feel soooo bad that he feels he has to be responsible for his sisters cause he knows his dads gonna fuck something up. I’m trying to find a job but it’s always been the same all but one time when he was talking to another girl saying I was holding him back cleaning houses and I was a loser. After that time it’s always been well I make more money than you so you have to quit, like now we moved and I was supposed to get a job but I can’t he has my car to go to work. 

This is really all over the place and I am so sorry I just don’t know what to do my oldest is 18 and then I have a 13 yr old and a 5 year old. If me staying with his dad trying to have a “ real” family fucked him up what’s it going to do to my girls ? It’s not like I have anywhere to go anyway my family is so toxic my mom passively treats me like shit most of the time. I have no friends anymore my one cousin is so messed up right now with drinking and screwing her life up I can’t turn to her. My brothers been staying with my mom during the week and hotels on the weekends cause he’s fuxking up in life right now! My youngest sister the golden child looks down on me so I can’t go to her.  I don’t wanna mess my girls

"Depression, Depersonalization, Emotional Abuse. HELP.","Since about November 2019 I’ve started to experience symptoms of depression but i just thought it was some sort of phase or something since I’m just a teenager but its now Jan 2021 and those symptoms have constantly been in my brain like they have almost become apart of me. Plus I’ve started to experience a few symptoms of depersonalization disorder but once again it’s only a few and usually I only feel the symptoms to this when I'm doing stuff I know my parents would yell at me for. For example one time I smoked weed with some people and In the moment I knew I shouldn't do it and but I felt like telling myself no was just like watching a movie and trying to tell the actor not to do something but what ever you say you can't change the outcome. I didn't get caught but that whole time I felt like I was just on autopilot. Idk if either of my cases could even be diagnosed because I only have a few of the symptoms (but these symptoms are persistent) but not all that are required to actually have the disorder. I feel like these stem from emotional abuse but once again i feel like the “abuse” is not like super bad but its there. Like I’m consistently told I’m the cause of stress in my house and  I get yelled at for the littlest things but then an hour later they’ll give me a hug and forget it ever happened ( this happens everyday). I have a sense of isolation from my family like I live with them but I'm like an outsider that doesn't belong. Also I feel like I'm forgetting how to be myself like I'm usually considered the funny guy or that guy just always knows how to have fun that's but like recently I've noticed A LOT more of my jokes are missing and me being excited or funny comes off as trying too hard. I don't really know what I’m asking for just any advice?

So this was saved as a draft about 3 days ago and reading it again makes me realize that my situation is actually a little bit more sever that I thought.

My friends doesn't believe in be and doesn't respect my wish to be alone for a while,"My friend doesn't believe in me and doesn't repsect my wish to be alone for a while.I have a problem with a friend in which I could really use some advice about.

In mid dec. I told my nearest friends, that I need to be alone for a while. I was waiting for starting in a treatment with some therapeuts, and needed to step back since all the expectations from my surrounding became too much and left me up with anxiety. I cancelled christmas, new years eve and went on the sick leave. I've been depressed since the beginning of last year (maybe months before acutally) when my now ex, broke up with me.

And this has been the BEST thing I've ever done to myself.I do have contact with my mum, who supports me 100%. And a little with my dad, whom I struggle with. And this leaves me to focus on how to deal with him, since that relation in itself has been so toxic for me as well - so much that I didn't had energy to focus on it. Because I have so little energy atm.

This one friend, let's call her ""ST"" is the one I'm having troubles with.

December was tough. A family member choosed to not talk with me anymore, December should have been anniversary day w. my ex + it reminds me of my sad little family, not so many friends and two earlier suicide tempts (another ex + a dear friend). So Dec in general is a REALLY tough month for me. I went on the sick leave this Dec, because it just became to much.I then called ST to tell her about my choice - also telling her that earlier this year I was so depressed, that I tried to take my own life. But that I'm not there anymore, but fear to end there if I don't take myself seriously. She got mad and told me that being on the sick leave is the most stupid thing ever - because I was ALMOST recovering, and almost starting up my own business etc.I got angry and told her that I just needed my friends to believe in me - and believe me when I said that this choice was the right one for me. And hearing others concerns doesn't help me - but just feeds my anxiety about not pleasing anyone. She got irritated and told me she's allowed to have an opion.- I never told her she's not allowed to. But sometimes she can't see what's proper to tell someone who's having a hard time.

One week after, she broke the bond to a mutual friend who's also on the sick leave.He's much much worse than me. Still ST took everything personal and got angry. Which was the thing our mutual needed to talk about - telling that the anger made her feel more anxious than supported. That has affected me as well. I have trust-issues and now fear any moment what ST thinks - I usually please her. This is what the mutual friends also did, and this turned out bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow. ST  invited me to celebrate christmas with her and her family.  I told ST about me going in self-isolation + staying away from So-Me from mid Dec - untill ""??"".. This to focus on my health, self-healing ability and take one little thing at a time. While also telling her ""thanks but no thanks"" about celebrating christmas.Still I felt I had to write her a message telling - ""this means I won't come for christmas, but thanks again"", Because I feared she would be upset.

Afterwards she textes me like... 4 times.. Messages like:""Hey, I'm so worried, can you please answer me?""

EVEN thoug I told her that this self-isolation meant that I wouldn't have contact with people around me! Because that pushes me back.

I then ended up pleasing her, messagin her in the end of Januray that I'm recovering slowly and that, as promised, I'll get back when I'm back again"".

Yesterday I saw her big brother on the street and I kinda ""had to"" say hello to him. Yesterday was the same day I startet therapy, so I looked like a mess (+ was a little embaressed because he's god damn beautiful and has always flirted with me). I told him to say hello to ST, tell her she's missed and that she shouldn't be worried because I'll still keep my promise and get back when I'm ready to be social again.  (yearh, because I knew he would tell her he saw me....)

5hours later she texted me twice:

""Hey, I'm SO WORRIED! I need to know that you're okay?""""Hey, just like my message - you don't have to write a long message or anything""

I'm a mix between angry and understanding.- maybe she's concerned that I'll take my life again? And this is her way to show love - just showed through concern?

\- but I'm SO  angry for the fact that she doesn't trust in me? Her concern makes me so angry... I've already messaged her TWO TIMES even though I told her I wouldn't answerany messages. Telling her I'm fine and that I'll get back. Can she just leave me the f\*\*\* alne and believe that I'm doing fine, taking one small step at a time. THIS is one of the reasons why I had to take a break from people. If I believe in their concern about me not getting better, I won't be better. The last time my dad told me he though I would kill myself - I wasn't having some selfharming thoughts. But then I started having them - just to prove that he was right. I won't let this selfdestructive way of pleasing get in touch with me again. And being away from people, only having contact with my mom, has changed my habits into being able to wake up, going outside, making food (once in a while) and start to work on my traumas.But know, because of her messages, I fear I get stuck in the believe of not recovering. I know it's not her wish, but that's how it affects me... My therapy sessions is mainly about relations. I don't understand them and this is also why I need to start the therapy alone and then, slowly this or the next month, I will begin to open up again and see some friends again.

I just can't function now, because this things with ST gives me troubles breathing. I couldn't sleep and I haven't been able to eat anything this morning or do my morning yoga, because I can't deal with this. It's too much. And my therapy session was yesterday (which also knocked me out) and I have to wait 2weeks to get there again, so now I'm stuck with these thoughts..

I really need some perspection, some advices, on how to deal with this. &lt;3 Please &lt;3","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1

It’s been years of not being able to get much pleasure out of things. I’ve now reached peak depression because I no longer have any hobbies or interests, goals and passions, I don’t feel the need to socialize and make friends anymore, I don’t do anything with my life and I gave up trying because my mind and body did years ago. Ever since getting out of high school I haven’t thought of anything to do with my life because my depression has gotten so bad that there’s no point in trying anymore because all I see is darkness. I’m not good enough I feel, and that anything I do isn’t good enough so why try. The pandemic has made things much worse and I’ve already had a suicide attempt back in November, and I’m still suicidal since my last attempt, and I have a strong feeling that I won’t live long because my depression has made it so that the pain is overtaking the will the live any longer. These past 4 years, I’ve only had a few days where I felt okay-ish, but 99.9% of these days out of 4 years have been depression, so I feel that it’s not worth living anymore. I don’t know how to get out of this mess. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. I’ve tried multiple antidepressants and therapy hasn’t been working so far. I’m isolated and suicidal. I’m afraid I’ll always be this way so I want to stop living. My negative thoughts keep me even more depressed because the future just seems to be more depressing and lonely. So why live it.

What is going to make me not depressed if I have been consistently clinically depressed for over 3 years? 3 mother fucking years and this shit hasn’t went away. I’m losing value in life, it feels like a shitty game that’s no longer enjoyable and I’ll gladly stop playing it. Life feels like a joke to me now, I just can’t live anymore. Nothing on this planet has been making me want to stay alive. Maybe I wasn’t meant for this world? My shitty upbringing and years of depression of anxiety, some people weren’t meant to survive in this world.

Afraid of not being depressed," Is it normal for me to be afraid of getting better? I'm 18 and I have been depressed for around 5 years.

I am getting paranoid,"I can't sleep no more since 2 days
I have the feeling of being watched the whole time of something not human but humanlike.
I am so tiered at this very moment. 
I flinch at every sound and getting kicked out of my sleep even its just the crackling of the wooden floor. 
I am afraid of opening doors because I am scared of opening doors, because I fear there is something in the room, waiting for me.
It all started with one crappy horror movie which was not even scary. It was really bad with huge logical gaps. I even laughed at it in the first place. But now? It is like my brain was rewriting the story just to intimidate me.    
But every time I talk to a family member it is just like it never existed. But as soon I close the door it is starting all over again. 
Every time I think I can sleep now, I just get the feeling again if something is approching me and heading for my neck. Even right now
Pls guys help me. I am so tiered. I can't think anymore. This was the only thing that came into my mind. 
Maybe it is helpful to know, but I got ADHD as well. I don't know. 
Pls answer as soon as possible. 
Every answer will be appriciated

In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that.,"So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him. We are both mid 30’s and have a real connection. We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each other’s places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn.
He is literally my one and only friend, I’m terrified of having another talk about my feelings with him in case I push him away again. 
We didn’t speak for a few months as he wasn’t very understanding that I couldn’t stop loving him. I cried every single day when we stopped talking and this was during lockdown last year. It was awful, I think about him all the time and I have a lot of trouble sleeping with my mind just racing. 
Mostly When I’m with him I genuinely feel myself and happy, but then I always wish for more. 
I don’t know what to do, I feel like if i stepped away again from our friendship I wouldn’t last. It’s not that I want to end my life, but for awhile now I just wish I was dead. He keeps me tethered here, so I don’t know do I just hide my feelings and say nothing and hope the friendship works. 
I would have been a very outgoing, proactive and positive person but I don’t feel that anymore. I burst out crying a few times a day about my life, I don’t really sleep, I can’t really eat which isn’t good cause I’m already v skinny. 
Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I don’t have the guts to go through with it. 
I’m really hoping someone can share some advice, I have done therapy and seen doctors but I didn’t really find it helped.

I'm 25y/o female from India. My depression keeps coming back in waves that pushes me into a full blown breakdown every few months. I don't know what to do. How do I get better?,"I have struggled with depression for a few years now. I live in a conservative family and my childhood was toxic, abusive and lonely. Things keep coming back to me now as I grow older. But I've learnt to use my coping mechanisms and get better every time I start to fall into the darkness.

However, two months back I had to deal with an abusive episode at home and I have not been able to bounce back. I'm jobless. I'm preparing for a competitive exam that requires me to study for at least 10 hrs a day and clearing it will mean freedom for me. All other options I have don't lead to freedom for me. I've invested the last two years of my life in this and now the exam is just five months away but I find myself unable to even get out of bed on most days.

The best day I've had in two months was when I somehow managed to meditate and study for 3 hrs. I'm fed up struggling and I'm losing hope. But I want to get better and I want to be able to function and meet the demands of my life right now.

I don't have the money or family support to consult a professional for help and so I've come here as a last resort hoping that someone will be able to show me a light. I want to get better so bad. I believe it's possible for me to create the life I want. I'm just unable to see a way out of this darkness. Please help. How do I get better? What do I do to be able to stop feeling so lost and study?

P. S. Due to my lack of access to a therapist I've learnt all the tricks like exercising, meditating, Journaling. And I'm trying these but nothing is working. I feel no joy even in things I used to love.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Motivation for getting better?,"Hi guys,
I really don't mean to be a downer, I'm just looking for advice (and maybe others who are/were in a similar situation to mine). 

What do you do if you don't really *want* to get better? Sounds horrible, I know... I don't mean I'm enjoying how I am currently, but more like...it's been so long I don't even remember how it was to not feel like this, I'm so low on energy it's a miracle when I brush my teeth or eat some vegetables, so I'm not really capable of dreaming of a better life now. And even if I were, I don't think I deserve it. 

I'm 21 now. I really should be doing this on my own, not to mention I try to not let my parents know how bad it is. But I just feel so weak and helpless. I don't know where to go from here. I'm not even that scared anymore that I'll kill myself, despite the frequent thoughts, because I know I don't have the energy, and the will to even actively want that. I'm having a hard time describing this. It's like...total numbness (except for the breakdowns sometimes), no will to do anything, even if I try to do something, my brain is having a hard time comprehending anything. I could and would rather sleep all day, every day. It's a bit unnerving, like I'm not even alive anymore.

So...if any of you were ever in this situation, what helped? Did you ever find a motivation? Or did you eventually just got yourself to therapy and went through the motions and it worked? Or...what the heck do I do?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1

I'm about to confess to my family how bad my depression really is but i dont know how.,"I, 27M somewhat purposely f*cked my life up.

Sorry for my bad English, not a native speaker. 

I did everything i could to rack up as much debt as possible. Started ignoring all my friends and parts of my family whom i used to be really close with. I stopped taking care of my rented apartment and myself. So basically I'm living in a web of lies. All of this was basically to make it ""easier"" to k*ll myself. 

But i now realized i can't do it because it would destroy my mother, brother and sisters..  i know they love me and would do anything for me to make me feel better. But its easier to lie and say everything is fine and avoid talking about feelings.

Advice on personal hygiene/self care,"Hi everyone! This is my first post on reddit so please forgive me if I don't do this right :p

I've struggled with severe depression for about 12 years or so now, and lately it seems to be getting worse. It's gotten to a point where I don't have motivation to do the most basic of things - such as showering daily, brushing my hair, even brushing my teeth... it's incredibly embarrassing, but I just can't find it in myself to care. I used to put a lot of effort into my appearance, and I took pride in how I presented myself. Now though, I feel as if it's pointless. I feel like the way I present myself currently is an accurate portrayal of how I feel inside. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to change this, or how to find motivation, or anything at all? I'd greatly appreciate any ideas on how I could improve on this. I feel ashamed when I show up to work in the same outfit, or with my hair in a tangled bun because I couldn't be bothered to brush it. Not ashamed enough to change though, I guess.

Advice on intrusive thoughts?,"Hi! I’m 19F and have been going through a depressive episode since late December/early January. It’s the first time I’ve had this, or at least to this extent. I’m on 50mg sertraline, but have begun to decline again more recently, so am making a doctors appointment about the possibility of increasing my dose. My parents are both mental health professionals so I’m pretty lucky there, able to get advice on how to verbalise feelings, and what they think I would benefit from.

Anyway, the reason I’m writing is because I’m suffering pretty badly with (what I can only describe as) intrusive thoughts. For me, they’re all memories of times I’ve hurt someone or done something negative. A lot of them are extremely minor or where nobody was hurt, but I do so much mental gymnastics to the point that they seem life destroying. They almost feel like flashbacks, and I get more intense panic than I had while the events were actually happening. They’ll come if I’m doing uni work, watching TV, in the shower, just woken up.. it doesn’t matter. 

So my questions are; has anyone experienced this sort of thing? If so, how do you deal with it? I’ve been recommended EMDR and given details of a good therapist who could do this. Is this recommendation echoed by anyone with personal experience?

Is this normal?,"Hi, I don’t know if this is the right place for me to ask this but I need answers from those who are in similar situations as I know depression can be tough.

I am recently friends with this guy and he was a super nice friend. Along the way, he opened up about being depressed and all. For the past 3 weeks, he suddenly started to cut off our convos short and never made any plans anymore. Each text would end less than 5 mins with him telling me to rest, study or something. But then he came back like everything was fine.

We also have a common enemy which he tends to talk about. But as soon as I talk about that person, sometimes he is supportive, but sometimes I’ll be hearing remarks like “oh, him again?“ or “life happens”. I don‘t think I initiate the talk about the enemy much but I do talk about him time to time when he, himself brings up the topic but then again, sometimes I’ll face the same remarks. 

Am I doing something wrong here? I genuinely felt hurt by his behaviour and I want to know if this is something I should approach him about or it is because of his depression. I would really appreciate if anyone could confirm this for me.

Depression after my scoliosis surgery,"Hello everyone,
I've had a surgery on 10th of February, since my scoliosis reached about 60°. I was happy I was getting the surgery at first, seeing it as an investment in the future. Without it, I would have experienced extreme pain in later stages of my life. However, after i woke up from the surgery I've been hit with nightmarish pain, unable to sleep for almost two days. Since then, I've been worried if I have made the right decision. Hearing nurses say that people are recovering after just three days got me really sad, as i can barely move around in my bed without major pain. I'm feeling really desperate, as if there is no escaping from the pain, as I feel plenty of it even under hospital medications. I had a friend that underwent the very same surgery, i looked up to her as she was able to live easily with it, as if she never was on a surgery. Unfortunately, I fucked up our friendship because I was a dick. I greatly regret it since now i see what she had to go through and how strong she was. Now I have no one to reach out too about this. If someone has any experience with a scoliosis surgery or can help, please do

Back on the meds,"Back on the Prozac &amp; Abilify...

I know it’s for the best. I know I have a medical condition that needs treatment. At least that’s what my therapist says. That made me feel better for a little while, but I can’t help feeling a little resentful as I swallow the pills. Why can’t I just reason my way through the sadness? Why can’t I just see the hope through the pit of despair? Why can’t “having it all” fill the huge gaping hole? Why do I have to let myself hit the bottom before I can decide I need to stick to the plan? Why with forums like this and such a greater openness about mental health do I still feel so alone? 

Nothings seems worth it. I can’t even bring myself to cry about it. That seems worthless too. It’s getting harder to fake it and push through. Being an adult only makes me want to run and hide more. There’s always so much to do, but I can’t anymore. Then I think of my little family and I feel so much guilt that I could think about leaving them.

Should I go to high school reunion if I had a terrible past?,"Basically, in my high school life I went thru social anxiety, depression, lots of negative emotions so I didn't even create strong connections with these people. They are now inviting me over, but the thought of going there... eeek! It's awkward and they're all going to be connecting or recounting their memories or whatever...meanwhile I had a shitty past. So, it's not like I can go there and act all fairy dairy. Idk. Initially I actually contacted a friend but now I'm hesitant because the circle is getting larger and they're inviting a teacherlol.. I can't pretend to be happy when I just had a terrible experience.

So... I don't know what to do. Lol! I even imagined sharing them my experience in the future, and hopefully they would understand and I could perhaps recreate a friendship? Lol. But when it's people from your past ... you can't help but associate them with the past.

My girlfriend has depression and I don’t know how to be there for her,"We’ve only been dating 5 months but we lived together for 4 because of the pandemic. Recently I came back to live in my house and discussed that we would see each other a few times a week. 

She changed a lot after I left, she went to see a lot of friends and only saw her once. She started therapy sessions and told me she feels really unhappy. 

As someone who struggled with depression myself I understand which is why I’m so conflicted. I want to be there for her but I don’t know if she wants me to. I don’t want to smother her but I want her to know she has my full support and I’m here for her for anything she needs. I was debating whether to ask her if she wants me to come live with her again but she was the one that suggested to stay in our own places again because it would be better for our relationship. 

I’m just terrified of her breaking up with me because she wants to sort herself out. It would break me. Should I ask her if she wants me to go back? Should I take initiative with things or let her tell me when and what she wants? I just want her to feel loved and supported but I also know she’s very independent and doesn’t like asking for things.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've suffered from depression since my teens so I know the deal and all the little self care things I can do to help. I'm just low on spoons right now. I'm on medication but have missed 2 doses due to napping and being off schedule. I'll get back on track today though. This is most likely why I'm in a slump today and things feels worse right now.

I was in a bad depressive episode for about 4-5 months in 2020, like many others I'm sure. I felt it was finally lifting, but it seems I was wrong. The stress of home learning, being stuck at home, having no social circle or bubble at all has really hit me hard. 

I don't have many friends, to be honest just one very good friend for the last 20 years or so, but due to COVID-19 I haven't seen her in about a year. We talk on the phone but it's not the same. 

For the last 10 years I considered another single mom my friend, even though we rarely saw each other and were not close. The friendship was toxic for me and we had many talks about what wasn't working, what was and what I needed from the friendship, with no improvements and I was always sad with this friendship. I ended it last night after talking about things again for the last week or so. I know it's the right thing to do for myself, but it's so hard.

13 years old. Wanna die,"Hello Reddit. This is my first post. I have read some post of other people here so I think I want to share my thoughts so that I can get help and your options on how can I be better.

First off I live in Hong Kong. I have been studying for a while. I am now having a never important exam that I need to have soon. I have been studying for 24/7 but never get any results. I don't like studying. But out of studying. I have no hobbies and friends. I am not good at sport and art or even music. I can just study. I need to improve myself. But I can't. I get that being top 5 in my grade is nice. However I can never feel happy. I hate my teachers. They always force us to do the work in their ways.

I wanted to die. I can't find the meaning of life. I can't find joy. I wanted to die. Every thing I have done is trash. I cannot find anything that will make me happy. 

I tried talking to my parents. However no one cares. They just said oh. And that is all. I really needed help but I cannot find anyone that cares.

"hi, i don't know what to say but here it is."," 

okay, so well i think i have depression or not I don't know I am just confused and numb and sad all the time.

I have a very loving family and I tried talking to them but they don't seem to understand they are trying but they can't ( dad=intj, mom=estj, grandma= estj) I have good relationships with all of them but they cant get around my mental health. They are already very stressed I can't stress them anymore and I am actually ashamed and embarrassed of talking to them about this.

I have a intp cousin she knows me well and is a loving sister but her life is already very shity and i cant bring myself to talk to her out of guilt.

I consider myself as a very privileged person and by that I mean that I have a loving family a secure house food on my plate clean water and just I have everything better than everyone around me and I just feel like a burden and failure everyone is trying so hard for me I don't even know what I am depressed about...

I sometimes fear that I am making this all up and that my subconscious is telling me t do this for attention... i am sick of worrying people I care about.

I need professional help and i know that but it is complicated.

I just keep having meltdowns and just feel like someone is always constantly standing on my chest .

I just feel like I am becoming a ungrateful unhumble piece of shit who does nothing but complain and become a burden or pain in someone's life.

I won't lie I think about dying a lot awful lot but I know I wont commit suicide as I have a strict code of conduct and my morals don't allow me to commit suicide unless it is to save a innocent person.

I need advice from someone who thinks like me or just can help me out and is emotionally stable themselves I really don't want to become a emotional mess with a lot of ego...

it is taking me a lot to post this would appreciate sincere piece of advice a lot.

Thank you for even reading this far...

have a good day.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Feel like dying but won't do anything stupid to myself (28F),"I feel like an empty hollow being just existing. I feel like disappearing. Yet Ive never gone far to act on my suicidal thoughts and I know I don't harm myself. But I'm tired of living this way. Tired of struggling with major Depression, anhedonia, anxiety and chronic headaches/muscle tension. Sometimes I think, if I have no fear of death then why don't I just do something crazy with my life and just go for my dreams and just push myself to exercise more. But I don't even know what my dreams are now. I don't know what I like anymore and it's hard to enjoy things. I just watch shows or try to take walks and keep avoiding my responsibilities. Ive been losing my confidence and losing sight of myself.

 I keep praying for some sign with the little wavering faith I have.. Others have been praying for me too. But I just don't feel connected with people as much even tho I have some friends that have been checking up on me... I just don't feel close to them. I don't feel good or necessarily sad, just mostly apathy and emptiness. I dunno what to do with myself. I found purpose before but then I lost it when I became depressed again. I feel like I can't tell what helps my body anymore. 

What keeps you going ? What makes you feel a little happy ?

suicide,"hi.

pretty much the thing is 

everything is going downhill 

I’m seriously considering commuting suicide. I already have multiple plans and locations chosen. 

I don’t have a phone number or any sort of texting device I can use in private. I haven’t told my parents that I think I need to seek psychological attention. 

They’re constantly judging me and taking away things that are extremely important to me and pretty much keep the mental strain in check. 

I still haven’t gotten diagnosed with anything but I wanna be able to share my thoughts.

How do you date while depressed?,"I really want to start dating, but I don’t know how to tell people about my depression (or just the shittyness of my life in general).

I deserve happiness so I do want to date, but it all just feels really unfair towards the other. I don’t want to start dating someone just for them to find out after a month or something how big of a mess I am and then either leave or stay out of pity.

Texas ice storm - feeling guilty &amp; overwhelmed,"I live in Texas, and my community is in need of a lot of help. I was out of town for the worst of it, and was lucky enough to come home to all of utilities still on, no damage to the house, nothing. I even had a good amount of food in the pantry. I housed a few friends, and donated to some organizations, but still feels like I’m not doing enough. 

Specifically I’ve been invited to volunteer this weekend alongside other people from my industry. However, yesterday I wanted to get my house in order first, but ended up lying in bed, and eventually falling asleep for a few hours, because it all just seemed so overwhelming. Cue guilt for neither volunteering nor getting anything done around the house.

Today I’m in the same boat. I apologized and told the volunteer crew I’d definitely be coming today, but again the house is still a mess, and I need to get it back in shape before I go back to working full time tomorrow. Funny thing is that I could totally do both, but my depression/anxiety tells me I just need to hide in bed all day instead. 

Frustrating, because four months ago I started taking medication (been in therapy for longer) and it’s been incredibly helpful, but it can’t seem to take the edge off during this time of crisis....even though I’ve hardly been affected personally. I’m spiraling because I feel such a duty to help others, but I know I need to help myself first...and seems that I can do neither right now.

Want go back to my life before all of this. Please help! How can I get over this obsessive fear of others opinions? It is ruining my life,"I'm not sure if this is OCD, but I (19F) have been dealing with intrusive thoughts for almost 6 months now. They are somewhat similar to POCD, but I get gruesome intrusive images of men abusing children (it is never me), and I also get intrusive thoughts like ""what if she is being abused"" and ""what if that father is a pedophile who is abusing his child?"". I think I have these thoughts because I absolutely detest and fear child sexual abuse, more than any other act in this world. The thoughts are distressing, but I have been able to use online resources and tips in order to decrease the amount of thoughts. 

Lately though, I have been worrying over the 'groinal response', which is debilitating. I could tell immediately that it was not arousal. And it usually doesn't happen at the moment of the intrusive thought, it happens while I am ruminating and when my anxiety is at its peak. I can tell that this truly doesn't mean anything because of the fact that it just happens when I am super anxious. I could be watching a tv show involving nothing sexual, and get a groinal response due to anxiety. Though, whether I am anxious about being aroused by the gore in the show, I dont know. 

I think one of my fears, that lines up with POCD, is that I would EVER be attracted to any form of sexual child abuse. Because I used to watch shota as a child and read inappropriate underage fanfiction, this fear has somewhat tangible evidence. Even though I was the same age as the characters, it still disturbs me. I know for a  FACT that I have no interest in children, and that I never have (I am attracted to men at least 5 years older then me). This groinal response has me questioning though ""why would I have this if I did not fear being aroused by children?"" . ""Even though this technically doesn't mean anything, does the groinal response indicate that I think I am a pedophile?""  It is confusing, but I guess my fear isn't that I am a pedophile (because I'm not). I actually fear the possibility of me fearing that I am a pedophile... sorry if that makes no sense.

**I kind of deviated from the main point, but I think the root of all my fear, is from fear of judgment. I constantly worry like ""oh god, I had another groinal response. How will I ever explain this to my future partner?"" I even go as far as to play out scenarios in my head, where I try to detail my problems to people. I just find it hard to stop thinking about others opinions. I feel like if I were to describe my issues like I did above, so many people would think I am a horrible person. I dont want to be a bad person. But going through all this (the intrusice thoughts, grounal response, etc.) I feel like the scum of the earth. Like, even if it was due to anxiety and nothing more, who would ever get a feeling down there when ruminating about child sexual abuse?? I want to be done with this, and hopefully I will get better with the help of my new therapist. But this constant fear of what other people think is ruining me. I want to have lasting relationships, and feel like I deserve them. I want to find love, and have good friends. But I feel like I will never deserve it, even after I eventually get through this. If anyone has any advice or success in this department, please let me know. I know deep down that I am not technically a bad person, because bad people do bad things without worrying about being bad. But it is hard to accept that these intrusive thoughts paired with the groinal response does not make me a disgustingly vile person. I think I would be able to explain the intrusive thoughts to my friends and partner. But the groinal response??? Who would ever accept me and my past...**

Sometimes I cant even watch a tv show because my brain will be like ""See that main character you like, and aspire to be? You could never be him/her. Everyone in that show would think you are disgusting and would hate you on the spot."" Or , ""See that villain? Who is literally burning an entire city down? You are far far worse then him. He is an angel compared to you and your thoughts."" It might be a little exaggerated, but it can be like this when I am having a particular day (like today). I hate it. I dont want to think of myself as a monster anymore. And I want to stop obsessing about others thinking I am a monster.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

That kind of sounds like bullshit in general, and also felt very insensitive for her to have said.

For years now I've had a really hard time waking up in the morning, and I'm only able to get up at a reasonable time if it's an absolute necessity.  Even then I usually sleep in too long and am late for things.

It generally doesn't matter how much sleep I get, I still feel tired.  I can be super motivated to get up early as I'm going to bed, but I'll still feel like a zombie when I try to wake up and won't even bother.

I've started exercising more and feel a bit better in general, but still haven't found a way to fix this particular issue.  I don't know why something so simple is this difficult.

Any advice aside from ""Just get up!"" would be appreciated.

Thanks!","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Antidepressants has ruined me,I’m 17 and i’ve been taking antidepressants for a while and I was just changed to a new one and I was taking small doses of the other ones to “wean me off of it” ever since I was off I’ve been suffering from anti-depressant withdrawals. I feel really dizzy and tired all day I’m irritable I have weird pressure feelings in my head like zapping and I’m starting to feel nauseous I’ve felt like this for three or four days and I thought it was my new pills but it only started when I stopped taking my old antidepressants and I looked up withdrawal symptoms and I have them. I absolutely fucking hate pills I never wanted to go on antidepressants but I had to.

Birthday tomorrow...,"Well tomorrow is my birthday. I feel numb. You could hit me and I wouldn’t feel it. I usually get all excited and think about how to do my hair and make up, what I want to eat for dinner. I remember all my past birthdays. 
The past few weeks I have just thought about ending it. I’m not going to but I can’t stop thinking about it. My life feels worthless. I don’t feel like I help anyone. Obviously we can’t see too much of our family right now but that wouldn’t matter because we don’t all get along. 

My dad re married when I was 14. They had another kid. Same exact birthday as mine although 17 years apart. She is the golden child. They even had a drive by birthday thing for her to sing happy birthday. I’m under 26. Don’t want to say my exact age. 

I get I’m older and I get the older you get birthdays kinda get less exciting. But I feel like dirt on the ground to people around me. I feel lonely and I feel sad I don’t feel excitement. 

Again it’s just another day but it feels shitty. Maybe it’s the memories I miss I don’t know. Just wanted to get it off my chest. 

I’m scared to wake up tomorrow. I’m scared to have another year like I just had. I don’t think I can survive it. I barely survived this one. 

This isn’t a “oh I hope Reddit wishes me happy bday for validation” post. I just feel like sometimes on here I can share and get it out there. I don’t really have an outlet.

Existential Crisis,"

I feel sad and depressed because of this existentialism that has started for me.
The thoughts saying that nothing actually has meaning, happiness has no meaning, if I were to die in the long term nothing would really change. And these thoughts make me distressed and depressed. It came to me while I was walking my dog and I couldn’t get it out my head. I’ve gotten temporary relief by telling myself stuff like we choose to live our lives and looking at articles and posts online, but the feelings always end up coming back and I feel even worse. I keep having this thought that I want things to go back to the way they were, I want to live my life without these constant thoughts entering my head every moment. I’ve had this for a short while and it feels like it’s always in the back of my mind 24 hours a day.

Just been rough for the past month,"I don't really know what I'm hoping to get by writing this but, I've been doing really poorly lately. I get up, I work for 9-10 hours straight (consulting job), then I feel too exhausted to do anything else... I go to the gym at night, then I pass out and do it all again. I've been so miserable and so overwhelmed, and I hate myself for being so incapacitated. 

Most of all, I think I'm freaked out by feeling like it'll always be like this. I've been putting so much effort into keeping my baseline up - I eat regular meals, I sleep 8 hours, I work out, I meditate, I'm on antidepressants, and I've been going to therapy for two years. I've been feeling better, but again I still feel like shit, all the time. I can't stop belittling myself. It's so scary, and it makes me so angry. 

I don't understand how everyone around me, my family and friends, can go through the same stressors as me and be fine. And not feel concerned about their work, their relationships, if what they're doing is ""enough,"" and not be exhausted all the time. I feel so alone in this. My parents and friends don't really support me in this the way that I need them to, and I snap at them, and then I feel bad because I know they're trying their best, and they don't need to be here for me at all.

My mom found out I've been skipping classes. What do I do?,"So I've been diagnosed with depression, and am currently on meds. Though, they don't work 100% of the time. I have been skipping classes due to lack of motivation, anxiety, and fear. 

I don't think my mother believes I have depression, and still thinks it is the cause of my medication; As the person who has the illness, I can tell its not just the medicine.

She gets angry at me for skipping classes, (Rightfully so, but it still hurts because I'm not doing this for attention or laziness) and wants to talk to my guidance counselor and teachers. 

I know they are going to put it on me, because I am the one who's been skipping and not asking for help. I'm trying to attend as much as I can and get assignments done, but its never enough. It's true this is my fault, but I feel like they don't understand that I'm not doing this out of laziness; I'm doing it because I want to off myself and can't take this anymore. 

I've been having suicidal thoughts more recently, but I don't think I will be believed. I don't know what I should do anymore. I'm trying to bring up my grades and attend classes but my mind and body are so sick and exhausted.

I’m tired of pushing forward.,"Hello all. This is my first time trying to reach out for help and doing so with friends and family feels shameful because I am my family’s rock and support system. It’s never been the other way around and the few times I asked for some help from my wife it’s always ended badly.

I am 27 Male with a wife who is 28 and a son who is 3.

When I met my wife I was already depressed, though never clinically diagnosed. All the signs were there though. Always tired, no motivation, indulging in vices just to feel something. I had no purpose and in all honesty I never ended it because it would be more trouble than it was worth. My mother and sister would be hurt and financially strained from my sudden death so I just lived day in and day out trying to not to sink too low. They were my excuse to live.

After meeting my wife things because brighter. My family definitely noticed an improvement in my attitude and I started taking care of my self more. For a while we only hung out, nothing official yet so I wanted to put my best self forward in hopes of building a relationship with this amazing woman. A year later we married and she got pregnant. It was my sons birth that pushed me to go back to school and get a better job. Simply put my finances would not be able to sustain a decent life style.

I’ve noticed though that slowly over the years I’ve started to fall back into the same depressed state of mind. I am unbelievably tired all the time, I have started buying more alcohol than normal and spending more and more time playing online games in hopes of getting some moments or happiness in a day of glum. 

My wife has noticed and started complaining that I’m changing for the worse. I can see it but I just can’t seem to do anything about it. I have moments of motivation where I will be good for a couple days but then revert back. 

Recently I had a bad episode where I just started drinking and wallowing in self pity. My son was already asleep so he wasn’t exposed to it. When my wife came home she seemed concerned but didn’t really know how to react. She sort of pushed me away and told me to sleep it off. In the morning I wasn’t any better and I didn’t have the energy to get out of bed. My wife called my mother to come help and she did a decent job of making me feel better but I felt embarrassed about it. After she left I was disappointed that my wife wouldn’t hug and just sit with me and instead just push for me to be back to normal. After this incident I definitely haven’t been as open about my thoughts because I know she doesn’t really care or rather doesn’t know what to do. 
I have noticed that recently when we argue I will have moments where I want to react in self harm. This comes usually around the time when my wife and I go into a the quiet part of our argument when everything has already been said but we haven’t come to a resolution yet. In both in a state of calm anger. In this time I always want to bang my head against to wall or take a kitchen knife to my arm.

In the past I would tell my wife about these thoughts but it came across as me trying to manipulate her by threatening self harm so I know not to bring it up anymore.

At this point I feel like I’m in a downward spiral. I want to go back to when I put care into myself. When I gave my all every day. Now I feel like an empty shell pretending to live a happy life. By now both my mom and sister know it’s a facade but I can’t admit to it. I was able to power through it and make my wife and son my reason to live, not just an excuse , but a real reason to push forward but now I feel like I’ve lost steam.

What can I do to help myself? I know I have to be there for my wife and son but I feel myself slipping.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

To be honest I don‘t really know when things started but I was talking to a friend of mine (video-chat) about a month ago and after he asked I explained to him how I was feeling. When I was done he said something along the lines of „Hmm that kind of sounds like some depression you got there.“ 

Now to what I told him: I think I stopped expressing how I feel at any given time at least a year ago and since covid took hold things have only gotten worse. I can‘t remember the last time I cried (tbh i felt like crying pretty often lately) or truly told anyone I wasn‘t doing too well. I always pretend I‘m happy and everything is normal so neither my parents nor my friends start worrying about me. One thing that really bothers me is that every time my friends who I 200% trust ask how I‘m doing I tell them „fine“. The conversation with my friend was an exception i guess. I want to explain it to them SO bad but somehow I keep stopping myself. 

A minor thing that might be worth mentioning is that I unfortunately remember practically every single mistake in my only relationship I ever had with a great girl I am not really over yet, friendships and in general ALL THE TIME. I always have to distract myself with something because every time I‘m left alone with my thoughts I go down the good old „Why did I do that?“ „Why would anyone do that?“ „Whats wrong with me?“ „Does he/she still remember that?“ road. School is almost insufferable because it leaves me a lot of time to think to myself and unfortunately it‘s rarely happy thoughts. 

The thing that makes all this so hard to decipher for me is that I‘m never certain how I feel. I know it sounds stupid but it‘s the best I can describe it. I have some good days where I just hang out with friends in discord and play minecraft all day but there‘s always that thought in the back of my mind that I don‘t deserve this. In contrast to that I also have bad days where I feel like I‘m on the edge of breaking down and giving up on everything. One of the most common feelings I have is hate towards myself.

Now the part that every „aRe yOU dePResSed? taKE THiS qUiz!“ website asks: Have I thought of suicide? More or less.

I‘ll be as honest as possible in this part. I have thought about if I would survive the distance from the window to the ground outside. I have thought about if it would hurt very much to stab myself. I was never actually anywhere close to doing it.

I have also thought about if I‘m important to my friends or if they‘re just with me out of pity. I have thought about if the world would be any different without me in it.

So, I have some suspicions that I COULD be depressed. But I also think its possible that i‘m just imagining things because I‘m just awful. 

If anyone made it through this, thank you for your time. If anyone wants to spend their time giving me advice i would be grateful.

Brushing your teeth when really depressed?,"I had a bit of a dental scare recently and was able to end up brushing and flossing twice a day for a month until I was able to get to the dentist- I think this brushing was caused almost entirely by anxiety.

I went to the dentist, and they said no cavities, but when they did gum measurements ""there were some pockets of 4 and some bleeding, which we don't like to see."" They didn't exactly clarify what this meant, so I was like ""ah ok i'm fine"" and went back to my normal routine of basically never brushing my teeth because I can barely even get out of bed to pee.

I ended up looking up what the ""pocket of 4 with bleeding meant""  a week later and it said gum disease and bone loss, so obviously now I'm spiraling about all of my teeth falling out and having to get either numerous implants or dentures in my 20s...

The point is, I do need to not only maintain my oral hygeine, but at the moment I need to actively improve it before I get too far.

Anxiety will push me along for now, but I know that soon I will start to feel like my gums have recovered enough (even if they haven't), or just forget why I'm anxious, and I'll stop brushing.

Do you have recommendations for how to actually get myself into a habit to brush and floss my teeth- not just ""chew some xylitol gum"" or ""keep mouthwash by your bed and spit it into a water bottle""?

Stuck in a hole of lack of motivation/productivity,How do you motivate yourself to get tasks for work/personal life/self-care done daily? I usually feel pretty productive and motivated 1 day out of the week and spend the other 6 days at a loss for energy to get anything done and end up hating myself for being “lazy” and then stressing out over all the things I could have/need to do and then feel bad for even stressing out over all of it because “why didn’t I just do it? I don’t deserve to feel bad for myself when it’s as easy as just doing it”. Been stuck in that cycle for a couple months now. Anyone else been through this?

How to help my friend get help,"So I have a friend who is very clearly depressed.
She has also confided in me her substance abuse and eating disorder.
Her parents are divorced.
Her mother used to bruise her nearly every morning during elementary school.
Her mother never listens to her.
Her mother and grandmother encourage her eating disorder.
Her mother genuinely blames her phone for her problems, even the aches.
Her father is just the densest motherfucker and, while he would probably want to help her, he is too stupid to realize she is telling the truth.
Her sister would probably just push god onto her if she went to her again.
She selfharms by bruising herself and has had thoughts of suicide.
As mentioned before, she has substance abuse issues. She drinks too frequently and has also taken prescription medication.

Her family won't do shit to help her and fuck the public school. How do I help her?

She isn't even 17.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Suicidal and going to be a father,So it’s a long story but basically I’ve realised Today I’m actually suicidal. Basic short of the story is. I was with my gf for 4 months was the most intense and passionate relationship I’ve ever been in and I’ve loved her more than I’ve ever loved anyone. She announces she’s pregnant and changes due to hormones ect and I struggle to cope due to the stress of finding out I’m going to be a father so I drink and we argue constantly. Then she suddenly leaves me and i become a full on alcoholic drinking everyday in complete despair 6 weeks go past and I’m too afraid to message her but I do think about this child and I can’t just Abandon it so I Eventually decide message her to tell her I want to be a father to this child. She says she will let me be involved cause she wants the child to have a father. But tells me she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends and civil for the child. Saw her for the first time in 6 weeks yesterday and I thought it would make me feel better but it doesn’t just makes me feel worse cause the pain is so intense. Tells me she never wants to get back together with me and at this point I was looking at the floor my lips trembling and I’m on the verge of tears and I’m pretty sure she knew this and she said we could be friends but in a way that she was trying to comfort me and basically say atleast I’m in your life in some way. She showed me the scan photo and today she went for another scan and sent me the video of the baby’s heartbeat and tbh I know I should be happy but I’m not I’m so depressed I just wanted cry cause I can’t bear not being with her. Now I asked her for a pic of the baby scan and she said later she’s out. I strongly suspect she’s having sex with someone and I just can’t cope.she left 6 weeks ago and I’ve not been happy since I’m constantly having to contain my tears and my anger and I just don’t see the point anymore. I’m even jealous of how much she talks about the child like that’s all she cares about and I never mattered. I do want to be a good father to my child when it’s born but at the moment it’s hard to see past this pain.

Is it ok to not want to tell your parents why you're depressed?,"I'm depressed and my family knows this. I've been diagnosed and all that stuff.

I feel fed up please listen to me?,"Hi,

Since a young age I had a big need to be in showbiz. I was part of the chorus in school and did some plays. People thought I was good. Sadly it went nowhere like I had no family with connections. I made this friend who was a child actor but he had the looks and I lacked that department. 

Years later, I am living in the USA struggling the same thing and being older. I love to act. I really do. I try a lot but I can't do an American accent and people dismiss me or even make fun of me. I keep trying to reach out to people to make projects and I get ghosted. 

I moved to a big city to get opportunity and it is so competitive with crappy entry level jobs. I have done so many labor gigs to be able to survive, worked 24 hours straight and 0 acting opportunity. I have a job that gives me little freedom working 6 hours for 6 days a week and even there upper management writes me up for petty things when I work so hard and can lose that job anytime. 

I don't like anything else other than acting and it is me, all alone. I have a few friends but they deal with their own issues like alcoholism and such. I see people on my social media or my friend's friends who get acting opportunities in indie films and such and they do things that I could and makes me wonder... 'Why they don't cast me for anything? What is wrong with me?'

I have been to acting classes and I have barely gotten any feedback. I hear things like my accent or before I've heard I was chubby and ugly and I fixed it since I am fit now and put some fillers. It is just I feel nobody values me... It is easy to think so since my very own parents abandoned me and wanted no responsibility.

Any comfort would help please.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I cannot see a bright side or way out of my situation right now,"I'm a sophomore coming to the end of my second year at this school and I have made zero friends, done zero things with anyone since welcome week freshman year and have only spent two quarters on campus. And by the time I graduate I will not have spent a full year at SCU. COVID cut off freshman year, obliterated this year, I will get to do study abroad next year (which im very grateful for yes but it does have its downsides), and then senior year I'll graduate in the spring. There will be zero time for me to make any friends at SCU. I only have one quarter next year to do it in person before being gone until the next fall. How the hell am I supposed to make any sort of meaningful friendships or experiences in one quarter if I'm a stupid introvert. I'm gonna end up looking back on college the same way I do high school, four years of skirting the edge of fun and seeing everyone else have what I can't. I hate it, it's crushing me. There's zero hope for me, I will not have a fun college experience. Others will make friends they'll be friends with for years, I'd be lucky to make one for a day. I hate it I hate it I hate myself.

You have plenty of time"" and that gave me hope for a bit but that's gone now. I didn't make any friends last year, none this year, I've got one quarter to next year.

Oversleeping while depressed,"I have had depression for 18 years now. And I seem to go back and fourth between being somewhat normal and happy to just completely depressed to the point of no energy and suicidal thoughts. Well im back to that no energy and suicidal thoughts but ive also been oversleeping. I will quite literally wake up for work as late as possible then come home and go directly to bed again. This has been happening for the past 4 days now. Yes I am on meds and yes I see a therapist but next session isnt until the 15th.  What are ways I can avoid oversleeping and get out of this funk? 

Possible causes to this depressive episode: anniversary of my grandma's death. It was recently my birthday and i would only celebrate it with my grandma. Increased rumification.

I broke up wit my long distance fiance.,"We've been dating for 2 years. It's our anniversary today. He's in another country and he visited me once, a year and a half ago. He stayed for 2 weeks and we've only just been talking online after that. He has always had a problem of me having a different opinion from his. We have different views about things and I don't mind it, but it annoys him. He said I think he's stupid because I don't believe him. ""Believing"" him means agreeing with him. I held on because he's my first boyfriend and we didn't have any problem when he was here. He has good qualities and I chose to focus on those instead. However, we had a big fight today and I realized it's gonna be hard living together if he can't even agree to disagree. I'm so heartbroken. He has been my pillar for so long. I was in the dark before I met him. Now I'm back in the dark.

I feel a total lack of motivation to to do anything.
I’ve slept most of the day, each day this week. I’ve barely eaten anything other than chips and junk. Nothing I own or could stream seems worth watching. I consider myself a gamer, but everything I could play seems like a waste of time and energy.
I don’t even want to work or make money because what’s the point if everything you could buy with those earnings is just going to sit on a shelf.

It’s not just ‘right now’ either. I’ve always felt like this. It’s just exacerbated to the level it’s at now over the last year or so.
I take medication per my physician, but I feel like it’s so hot and cold on if it seems to do anything at all.

"I just told my parents that I had depression, it didn't go well at all.","No matter from where you are and which century you got born in, problems such as depression doesn't leave the world, everyone can get depression depending on the situation that they are having. My Iraqi parents went through alot when they were in Iraq, they went through tough wars and time where they don't have food or water. They moved out of the country to Dubai, where I got born and raised in.

We all know that depression can cause people to suicide, but my parents had another thoughts. 

I am a mechanical engineering student studying in Malaysia, for the past year, i got soo stressed by the amount of assignment, tests, lab reports, lessons that I have to study, and extra work that i need to do to have a good GPA. Going through al of that made me go insane and depressed, i reached out for help ofc, it helped abit but not that much, so I had to relay on myself, and heal myself. And thankfully, i'm doing well nowadays. 

I decided to adopt a cat recently, because first i like cats alot, and second, i read alot of researches that says pets can help people with depression. My dad is an animal guy, so he doesn't mind at all. But my mom has allergy and asthma, so convincing her is pretty hard. 

Today, I told my mom i had depression, and if adopt a cat it would help me alot to avoid the same senario. Instead of asking why I had depression and what caused it, she decided to say smth rude, which was:

 ""You getting depression because of school pressure and you wanting a cat is all a girl thing, don't be a girl and man up"" 

At that moment I felt that smth pinched my heart and I just wanted to leave the house to somewhere else, she made me feel as if my problem didn't exist and i was faking it just to get a cat, i was soo offended and now i'm scared that i'll get depressed again.

I know my parents went through alot, but they should take such situations seriously, no matter where you got born or in which century.

I'm still very grateful for every single thing they did to me, they raised me well, they gave me all my wants and needs, but this time....it just slapped me in the face and i'm so shocked.

Wife has been struggling with postpartum for 18 months,"Our son is 18 months old and my wife has been struggling with PPD since the first week. In some ways she has gotten better. The first month she would have breakdowns and cry and would have to leave the house. Since then she just seems apathetic to most things.

A typical day she won't want to get out of bed. I work remote so I will grab our son and change his diaper and feed him breakfast. She will get up after I ask her a few times. 

Being alone with our son stresses her out. Most days her mom will come over and watch our son or she will take him to her house. She usually just lays on the couch or in bed on her phone most of the day. 

When I get off work we will go pick up our son. Once we are home she will usually sit on the couch and she will interact with him a bit, but I do most of the child care. 

Once our son goes to bed, she usually will lay down in bed. She will usually have only been awake/out of bed for 8 hours total. 

She has told me she doesn't want to be a mom. It breaks my heart to hear her say that. I want my son to have a mother who loves him. I know she does but the depression covers everything up. 

She has been on  different medications and is going to therapy but nothing seems to ever help.

I don't know what to do anymore. I want to help but I don't know how. Some people in family have said we should do tough love and make her take care of our son more, or go out and do things. I don't think it is that easy though. 

Does anyone have any advice?

A therapist doesn’t want to see me because I have trauma.,"What the fuck. I feel so confused.


I had a consultation with a potential new psychotherapist yesterday, to which she told me we should “both take 24 hours to think &amp; see if we’re both a good fit,” to which I was fine with (even though I already had my mind made up based off of the description of services/expertise she had listed on her website.) 


After the 24 hrs passed, I haven’t heard back from her, so I emailed her following up about our session, and stated I’m confident with moving forward with them, just for her to email me back basically stating that she “doesn’t feel she’s a good fit for me since I have CPTSD,” and how she’s still an intern, meanwhile she CLEARLY states all of her credentials, some mentioning acute AND complex trauma! Along with helping marginalized communities/LGBTQ+. 


I should note I’ve seen two other counselors at this practice, but unfortunately can’t see them due to changes in insurance. They were the ones who referred me to this therapist.

Since then I’ve been much healthier and I’ve built a solid morning routine where as soon as I get up I shower and brush my teeth. But I keep struggling to build a bedtime routine as normally I just go straight to bed and crash out, sometimes even in my clothes, without brushing my teeth.

just need to tell someone this,"I’m 17. Today is my Dads 70th birthday.  That  might be surprising to some people because that’s pretty old to have a 17 year old son. Peers have made fun of me and said i’m probably mentally retarded  since my Dad had me when he was so old. This isn’t what the topic is though and it doesn’t even bother me. What does bother me is that my Dad’s 70th birthday is just a reminder to me that I don’t have much time left with him. At most another 10 years and that’s optimistic.  It just makes me so fucking sad beyond words to even think about. My Dad is my favorite person in the world and I can not even comprehend living a single day without him. I just wish so bad that I could be like every other fucking person and have a young Dad so I could have some more time with him. I truly don’t know what I’ll do when he passes. With how old he is, it feels like there’s really no way of knowing, when. It makes me sick to even think about it. but the hard reality is is that he could really die this year even. Or he could miraculously live until 100. But deep down I know that I have less than 10 years with him and it FUCKING KILLS ME.

For example: she will text me once saying something vague about her depression and then not respond for another week.

"I got kicked out of my house six months ago, and the only thing keeping me alive is fear, work, and my boyfriend.","(For context I’m 20, F, and very new to Reddit) 
I got kicked out of my house in late September, about a week after I graduated cosmetology school, due to an argument I got into with my step dad that resulted in him screaming, threatening, and punching the wall behind me. After two weeks of couch surfing, I bought a plane ticket to California (from Texas) with the last of my money, and moved into my best friends families home. 
It’s been six months now and I constantly feel like I should just give up. I got a retail job at a company I had previously worked for within about two weeks of me moving, and other than that I haven’t done much else. I don’t have a car, I haven’t looked into going back to school or pursuing any kind of education, I’ve had a couple of falling outs now with the friends who encouraged me to move here (best friend who I’m living with included), and my relationship with my family has never been more toxic. The only thing that is holding me together is this job, my boyfriend (who’s been doing his best through out all of this), and being too cowardly to commit to killing myself. 
And I hate that I’m posting all of this because it feels like such a pity party, but I don’t know what to do anymore.

Partners psychiatrist invalidates his feelings and even told him to break up with me.,"My partner was diagnosed with depression as a teen and has been in treatment since. 
 However he has been complaining how his psychiatrist  doesnt really care for his feelings/no empathy/ doesnt let him talk etc. 
We have been seperated by the border closure since Feb 2020 and obviously  this has been so hard on us both. We became stronger as a couple, but mentally exhausted ,appealing for an exemption and being apart from one another. He has been having a hard time these days, with loss of job and being apart,  So when he was talking about this to the doctor, the suggestion had been to breakup with me.  Clearly my partner is distressed and has not been having a positive experience  with her. She also thinks I'm with  him for visa.
 I am from a culture where depression is a taboo topic so I'm not  well informed about it. I have started my research, yet confused and want the best for him.
So, is it right for the doctor to do this? Is it normal? Because I feel like its unethical and unprofessional. Every time my partner comes out of it, hes tensed and more unhappy when it should be the opposite. 

I want to help my partner.  I am scared and I dont want anything happening to him and want to make sure I do the best for him. He is the sweetest person and he has never given up, and have always been trying so hard. He deserves the best care possible. 
Please advice.  

Also please give me tips on how to support him when the days are bad.

Anyone else (with long enough hair) been denied service by every hair salon for help with extremely tangled and matted depression hair? I'm losing hope.,"For context, I have long hair, and it's been matted to the point of (seemingly) no return for **3 months**. I've been able to hide it because everything's virtual. I just tie what I can back, and no one can tell.

It's matted to the extent that the majority of my hair is now just a hard clump of really tightly knotted hair. It's like a hair ball.

As the title states, I've been denied from every hair salon that I called up and were taking customers (with proper cautionary COVID measures), and I'm starting to accept that I might have to get a buzz cut at this point, which probably wouldn't help with my current mental state.

Every hair salon I called (14 total) would react in a way that made me feel really embarrassed. Especially because they always as ""How did it get to that point?"" or ""Did you leave gum in it?"" etc.

I told myself I was going to be really open and honest and just tell them I have been suffering from worsened mental health state (diagnosed BPD, OCD, &amp; PTSD) in hopes that people are pretty woke now in 2021... Nope.

"Please help, my girlfriend is depressed, I have no idea what to do.","M, Both 14 years old.

I've felt Depression. I remember there was a time where I hated going to sleep because when I was left alone in the dark with my thoughts, all I ever heard them say is how fucking horrible life is and how much I wanted to kk myself, and I would fall asleep every night knowing I would wake up the next day with no motivation or reason to get out of bed. Every day was dull and empty, every second was a living hell. I had no appetite, lost alot of weight, lost the will to live, god I hated everything. Eventually things got better, but to be honest it's kinda been happening again. Life's been pretty good for me, materialistically, I have good friends, my relationships with family are good, I have an amazing girlfriend, it's not as bad as it used to be, but I still feel like empty shit at times. 

But this isn't about me. My girlfriend lives a really hard life, which pains me so much because she's an amazing person and only deserves the best. Tonight was going well, we were in a call, we talked, did some homework, talked more, and then she left the call. Over text she said she wasn't ok and if it was a good time to talk about it, I said of course she can always talk to me. She starts talking about how she's been feeling down lately, how she barely ate today, how she feels empty, and how she can't seem to feel happy at a and oh my god it pains me so much. I tell her I've been somewhat feeling the same and that I'm here for her and I love her. I try to keep talking to her and I ask her to talk to me, but she kept getting more and more quieter, hesitant, then she starts apologizing, saying she's sorry for being a burden on me, saying that she's going to hurt me, saying there's nothing I can do to help her, and I'm trying my best, I told her I love her so many times, I told her that I'm here for her and I don't care if she's at her best or her worst, I told her that the next time I see her I'm going to hold her tightly in my arms and then give her a passionate kiss, that I'm going to buy her something nice and make her feel special, that I'm going to live her no matter what state she's in, but she was still being really quiet and eventually just left me on read so I left her along. I kept trying to get her to talk to me, I wasn't trying to make her day something she didn't want to tell me, I just wanted to know that she was going to be ok before I fell asleep. Idk I'm scared, a few weeks ago we were in a call, and she starts talking and venting to me about all the shit going on in her life, she starts crying really hard, then she admitted to breaking a mirror and cutting herself with it and that just fucking broke my heart.

What do I do. I have no idea. I love this woman with every fiber of my being. I care for her and her wellbeing. When I see her like this, it's like my heart loses a piece of it's soul, if that even makes sense. Please, help. Is there anything I could possibly do.

Edit: ok, before I posted this, I got insanely depressed. I wanted to get high and numb myself like I usually do when I feel like this, but I only have a little bit of thc oil in my cart left and I was saving it for fun times with friends and with her, and I didn't want to waste it so instead of doing that, I decided to write a song. So basically I've spent the last 3 hours writing and recording a 3 minute song (on guitar). I wrote it for her, about her, her pain, my pain, my love for her, and just whatever thoughts were impulsively racing through my head at the time. I just sent it to her, I'll update you guys in the morning.


And since I'm just now posting this, I would still like any advice you can give me.

I feel lost,"I won't bore you with my sob story of a past, it was horrible and has left me a mental mess at the best of times. I was getting better, was motivated to keep going in every aspect of life and wanted to make my future mean more than just getting to the next day alive, and that's exactly what was happening.

I'm a 20 year old who's still living with their parents because I don't make enough to afford a place to live.

I work five days a week, and have very little time to get out of the house.

My life is a cycle of abandonment, and false promises. I have a hard time trusting others, and a harder time trusting myself. I've been suicidal before, and I'm passed that, I'm to the point where I don't even want to put in the effort to attempt it. Everything I do in life is just leading to another dead end. I don't ask for much, I just want to be able to say I had a good day for a change where I smiled genuinely. I want one thing to go right. I want the cycle to break.

What should I try next?,"I have severe depression and anxiety. I am currently in a particularly bad episode. It is truly hellish and I can do very little. Between episodes I can be fairly high functioning, but I am finding that I am dilapidating more and more each year. Work and relationships are becoming increasingly impossible even during the 'good' phases.

I have tried psychotherapy (ongoing still), CBT, DBT, citalopram, venlafaxine (still in withdrawal), psilocybin therapy (produced traumatising hell trips), diazepam, lorazepam, propranolol, zopiclone, exercise (\~5x per week), sleep, SAD lamps, meditation, good nutrition, prayer, self-harm, changing jobs, going back to education, self-help books, sauna, ice-baths, living alone, living with friends, living with parents, float tanks, supplements and some other stuff. I have an ok job and live alone in an ok studio. Friends and family are generally supportive, although I have a poor, disconnected, awkward relationship with parents.

No matter what, the 'good' phases never feel that good and the horrifying, suicidal phases always keep returning. I think a lot of meta-cognition contributes a lot; fear of what others are thinking about me (especially partner and work colleagues), overthinking everything, regret and frustration about all these diseases are doing to me.

The best discord friends I’ve ever had suddenly cut ties with me back in October. I’m really hurt bad and I can’t move on.,"I had so many amazing memories with them. I remember excitedly hurrying home from work every day to chat and play games with them. We shared jokes and memes all the time. We disagreed and argued sometimes, but isn’t that how all friendships go?

In October(I think the eighth), I got a DM from one of them. They called me emotionally manipulative and declared the friendship to be over. In addition, they said I couldn’t do anything to reconcile with them; the decision was final.

They kicked me out of every discord server they moderated and I assume blocked me on all social media.

They never told me what I’m specific I did wrong. They never told me beforehand that something was going on. Right up until that DM I thought things were ok between us.

I just feel so evil and disgusting and not deserving of life. I loved them so much(platonic of course) and now it’s over forever.

How can I (28f) help my Mum (56f) who is depressed and considering suicide.,"My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide (to the best of my knowledge) twice before. She has never kept up with therapy (of any sort) as she doesn’t believe it works.
Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours - really just your average symptoms of depression.

In recent times (over the last 6 months) her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again:    
•She doesn’t socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years (daily gym and a monthly book club) and refuses to do anything ‘new’ (due to the cost).   
•She hates her job and her co-workers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself ‘too old’ to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as ‘they wouldn’t notice me if i was there anyway’. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldn’t miss a day ever!    
•She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesn’t like that they make her gain weight (~5kgs) OR shes feels that they have ‘done their job’ and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she won’t even consider making an appointment to get a script.    
•She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.    
•Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears (mostly when she is drunk) to ‘just talk’ and keeping us on the phone for literally hours (her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm) until she feels ‘better’ or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 7-10 days.     
•Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers (my grandma, 88f) increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that ‘people’ think she is trying to kill Grandma (which is completely unfounded). She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandma’s care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade - a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour.    
•She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the  the last ~2years. Currently she consuming 1-2 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker.    
•Frequently making statements such as  ‘just wanting to die’, ‘I should just die’, ‘someone should just shoot me’, ‘i’ll just die’. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day.
There have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most.

For further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her (and have done so for years) as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors  in her life recently.    
•Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time.    
•Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. -Grandma’s health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isn’t dealing with Grandma’s care anymore she is still stressed about it.    
•She believes she is getting bullied at work (claims to be getting ‘cold-shouldered’ and that people are hiding her belongings). She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word (which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state).

I have tried to help her by:    
•Convincing her to begin antidepressants again (which she is refusing to do, she will ‘get fat again’).    
•To at least see a therapist (she is refusing to as it ‘doesn’t work’, also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been ‘fighting’ with -see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused). I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible (saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house).    
•Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together (she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a ‘why bother’ mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she ‘doesn’t feel like it’).   
•Actively making plans with her (which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand). I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns (which they have shared) and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together (which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact) but she still has not been engaging.    
•Taking all her calls and trying to (gently) help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls (I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something).    
•Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try (as she claims she can not afford them). Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like (she took this offer as an insult that she needed ‘supervision’).    
•Offering to help her write a resume and cover letter for job applications.

Last night she called me in such a state that I drive to her home in the middle of the night (from 5 hours away) because I was sure she was going to harm herself and the local police station was unmanned for the weekend and I was advised that meant they couldn’t complete a welfare check until Monday morning. I am terrified that she is making an active plan to end her life and that if she attempts it she will probably succeed (the local ambulance response time is a joke and the nearest hospital is over an hour away). I have successfully helped her move through depressive episodes multiple times before but this is different. Both my sister and I am at our wits end and have no idea what else we can be doing or where to turn to. 

What more can we be doing?

TLDR: My Mum is depressed and highly likely to be suicidal. I’ve run out of ways to help, what can I do?

NSFW// i don’t know what to do,"TW!

i’m severely depressed and i don’t have enough confidence or will to reach out to anyone. partly because i’m a “therapist friend” and in the past when i have reached out i’m met with jokes &amp; not being taken seriously. my perfectionism is killing me. today my friend told me their mom physically assaulted them last night and all morning i’ve been stressing out, trying desperately to help them; i started creating a care package for them with a handmade necklace and their favourite things. they have a broken knuckle, bruises everywhere, a black eye, migraine

then i realised they would never do this for me, because they’ve been one of those people to make jokes. i tell them i’m upset and crying, they say “hi upset i’m (name)”. stupid, very childish jokes. and it isn’t that i need better friends.. they aren’t a bad friend. that advice just isn’t what i need right now, i’m lucky to have friends at all. because if they were a bad friend then everyone i know would be a bad friend, it’s been like this my whole life

maybe i try too much for others and in return expect too much, but i just want someone to be there for me. i wish i didn’t have to tell them how to be there, i wish they just did it out of genuine care. it wouldn’t matter whether it actually helped or not because even seeing effort would be everything to me. the biggest problems i normally get to talk about is annoyances throughout my day and after a while i’ve given up on reaching out because it falls flat. the people that say they’re there for me don’t listen. after years of this i just don’t know what to do, i’m so tired 

it probably doesn’t help that i most likely have autism and what typically comforts people usually doesn’t comfort me. i take things very literally and don’t understand 90% of people’s jokes even when i can recognise them as a joke. so maybe they say these things to make me feel better but to me it feels horrible, and i’ve told them that and i try to be serious but i feel like my communication just falls on unwilling ears. idk... i just feel so alone and i’ll take whatever i can get","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
I’m lost,"Suicide thoughts

First of all , I wanna say sorry for my bad English.I didn't go to psychiatrist , but I'm pretty sure I have depression for 4 years . Back then I just felt like I lost all my positive emotions (for no reason) all of suden and I told it to friends and family and everybody was like : It's normal, it happens , it will disappeared...I cannot feel almost anything, when someone close to me die, I can't cry , when something good happens ,I can't smile (sometimes (but very rare) I can feel euphoria ) . I had no motivation and hope for better future then, and now is same .I have little health problems for 5 years ,and I can't even force my self to go to doctor because I'm affraid of diagnosis, and things are worse now. People think I'm doing a little bit better then earlier because I passed my entrance examination for college one month ago(last year all my friends did it, I decided to make a one year break ) . But college don't change anything.I 'm still big pesimits and can't feel anything. Actually I can feel fear. I have very strong social anxiety. I have 5 very close friends , they are like brothers to me and I'm relaxed when I'm with them , but when I talk to girls , I'm totally confused. They even can't understand what I'm saying because I don't open my mouth enough and speak very quiet ... I never had a girlfriend... Let's go back to social anxiety.It's very hard to go to for example market because I'm overthinking what if someone asks me something, ... I have very good relationship with mother, not good but no bad relationship with sister , and very bad relationship with father (it's almost hate) . I also have very often mood changings and I also take decisions very hard because I don't know what I want , and even when I take a decision, I change it very quick . I like watching soccer and basketball but it's hard to concentrate to watching because my mind flyes somewhere... I can't find purpose of life. People don't understand how it's hard when someone says : JUST FORCE YOURSELF AND GO TO DOCTOR , JUST GO OUT MAKE NEW FRIENDS ,...

Need help with self-sabotaging behaviors.,"So I have been tapering off my medications now. I have been on medications for over 5 years, and it has not helped in managing my anxiety or depression. I feel more energetic now. The issue is, there is a demon lurking in my mind which comes out from time to time and creates havoc. For example I had saved a huge chunk of money from my first salary I received last month. Spent money carefully, was responsible enough, etc. A couple of days back, I grew so emotional and reacted so badly to some things that cried till my eyes, body and joints hurt. My body fell numb and I couldn't move out of the bed. I ended up spending 75% of my savings on things that neither helped me elevate my mood or had any practical use. This is not the first time either. Everytime I tend to do something right, I would do something extremely irrational immediately and try to spoil the one good thing that I have. I constantly think of running away from my house and live a quiet life in the suburbs, where no one knows who I am and where I come from. I have lost trust in myself to an extent that I depend on validation from others for my every little feeling. I don't trust what I think or feel at all. I am lost and can see only death as a solution from this unending misery.
Has anyone been through this before and got out of it successfully? If not, what are you currently trying rhaf may/ may not be working? Please provide some solutions that I can actually apply to my life and not the philosophical or religious ones, I have had enough of those.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

Soon to be dad and I’m struggling to cope,So I’ve written posts about this before but here’s the basics. My pregnant girlfriend split up with me. She said she dident love me anymore. I lost my temper and said some things I shouldn’t have which I admit was my fault. We dident talk or have any contact for 6 weeks I drunk heavily during this time and my depression was unbearable. I eventually reached out and apologised and explained I wanted to be there for the baby. She agrees I meet her for the first time since we broke up and she makes it clear she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends. So since then I’ve cut right back on my drinking intact I don’t drink anymore. As the son of a alcoholic looser father I don’t want that for my child I want to be a good dad. Anyway every time I talk to her it feels like a kick in the teeth. So I actively avoid messaging her and only respond to her when she messages me cause of all the pain it brings up. The only thing keeping me going is the baby. But it’s been 10 weeks since we broke up and I still feel just as broken and miserable inside. I don’t have any friends I sit on my PlayStation all day just trying to zone out and focus on something other than how miserable I am. I thought that when I stopped drinking I would feel better and to be honest I don’t I still feel like shit. I have a therapist who’s helpful and a support worker to help me not go back to drinking. But it doesn’t help much and to be honest I just don’t know what to do anymore.,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Do I have depression or something else?,"Hi everyone, please don't bite my head off as I'm pretty new to all this but I'm trying to figure out if what I'm feeling is depression or not. I recently realised that I've not been feeling okay for quite a few years, I googled some stuff and depression came up. Now I don't really trust random stuff that's written online so I  thought the best thing to do was  to speak to some people with depression on here and see if my symptoms fit? 

- no motivation to get out of bed, if my parents didn't force me to get up then I'd probably stay there until the late afternoon. 

- I always like I've been a disappointment, that I'm a failure and that I'll always be this way later in life 

- I find it very hard to focus on anything, my attention span is very low. I fidget and become aggiated pretty easily 

- I quite often find it hard to get to sleep, I'll end up staying awake until the early hours of the morning. 

I spend almost all day in my room. I feel empty, lonely and sometimes start crying over the past or present. 

- sometimes I make myself cry on purpose when I'm alone, I don't quite understand why I do that. 

- I find it hard to motivate myself to do basic things such as washing or brushing my teeth. I do them for my own good but it takes effort and I sometimes neglect those tasks. 

- I sometimes think about death. 

- I find it hard to care about anything. Then if I make a mistake over something I do find the energy to care about, I beat myself up about it harshly.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
Can missing morning erections be caused by depression?,"I understand that depression can lead to loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. But nowhere I find information whether missing nocturnal / morning erections can be caused by depression as well. And I'm not talking about a missing erection once in a while, but total lack of it every day for months.

In my limited understanding, morning erections are a pretty much biological thing, which can't be influenced by bad mood or thoughts, so I would assume a depression couldn't impact the presence of these erections.

I know about the side effects of antidepressants, but here I am just trying to find out whether regular, untreated depression can cause this lack of nocturnal / morning erections.

I feel like I sleep well enough, so missing REM phases is probably unlikely.

Any input will be greatly appreciated.

I ( 26 female ) have decided to take care of my severely depressed younger brother (20m ) by letting him move in with me last week and need some tips.,"Hey all ! I am new to the group and  a Canadian I would like some advice. This is a VERY long post so bare with me. 

 I took on basically taking care of my severely  depressed younger brother. I am 26 and my brother is 20.  I have been moved out for 4 years, my brother has been under child protective services from the overly toxic environment at home. 

 For some background mom is an addict ( alcoholic ) and dad definitely has mental illness and severe emotional disregulation and is severely controlling and overall unhealthy and manipulative  ( violent outbursts , tantrums, controlling ).they are both functional for the most part but very terrible to be around and our entire family became severely dysfunctional as a result and has suffered a lot.  

 In the past I have had reactive depression but am better now here is what I experienced ;  

Basically I can get depressed when sad events happen like breakup/ death or I would  experience severe anxiety when I lived with my parents ( to say the least )  .

I got depressed and severely melancholic ( experience debiliating guilt ans self-hatred )  and could not function well for months/ years after certain events happened so I relate to my brother and understand him very well. However, the difference between my brother and I is that I sought help and still speak to someone every 2 weeks.. 

My brother was always forced into help by CPS for example.  He also is a high-school drop-out (2x) because of the home environment and I know that the social stigma that comes with this has really weighed down on his self-esteem. He is very smart ( beat a Canadian chess champion at chess ) but he never takes compliments and feels like his depression has altered his ability to retain information ( poor memory, brain fog ) . He is VERY hard on himself and I almost feel like he would rather stay depressed as a way to self-punish himself for dropping out of highschool ( he even told me he feels like he does not deserve anything good because he is in his own words a  ""  loser "".. and feels like he is tired of being alive. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues ). 

I have been pestering my brother to move out of my parents for the longest time. He finally did last week  and came to live with me. I congratulated him for taking the right steps.I told him he always has a place with me. And this is why I still took him in despite having reservations as I am not exactly where I want to be in my life financially  either but I am doing better than him and better than before so I felt like it's worth a shot ( and still do ) . He has never worked a single job because of his mental illness and because of my parents hostility.

This past year I have focused a lot on healing from my own health issues: had two surgeries and heart issues but I feel better than ever before and also getting over a breakup which is hard for someone like.me who tends to get reactive depression as a result of difficult life events . 

I'm doing well at work, was recruited by my manager to follow into her foot septs and applied to a program  at McGill university that my employer would pay for the purpose of developping my career at the hospital I work for. I work in admin and might work in management following this management succession program ( if they accept me because even though I was recruited still waiting for acceptance letter ).

But it took me a long while  to get to a place where I can be stable enough (mentally) to get back on track or at least try too. I have anxiety too ( was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ) but I feel like it's been under control the last few monrhs. Moreover , I have my own fears of failure as I've had a difficult experience with school in the past even though I graduated highschool and college .. 

My brother is the sweetest person. He is 20, however  never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day... While my mom drank and my dad was aggressive all these years,  my brother would go hide in his room gaming all night and sleping all day and hasn't left his room until child protective services took him out for 1.5 years.  And they only did because I told them what was going on... Anyways. Fast forward and  now he is finally with me.

I want to be the best support but I haven't stopped feeling anxiety since he moved in. Like I am not eating as well and I am worried this will make me feel isolated or ruin my other relationships ( don't have many left haha but 2-3)  but also worried for him too as he won't eat unless I tell him to, won't move his body unless I  tell him to etc... Having him here reminds me of the misery of my parents and my childhood. Because he is unfortunately the result of a dysfunctional family.  I don't want to turn into my mom where I cook and clean all the time ( she is a functioning alcoholic but gets highly abusive when she drinks but still cooked and cleaned ) even though I cooked for.myself growing up as I'm vegan and she didn't want to cook vegan food for me when I turned 19. 

I want my brother to feel confident but he doesn't because he dropped out of highschool twice as a result of mental illness growing up. Before coming to stay with me he was starring to refuse food and had severe psychomotor retardation ( can't get our of bed ) and like I maybe mentioned before he has not gotten out of bed in a decade expect for when CPS got involved .

I booked him an appointment with a family doctor on Friday ( tomorrow )  and I spoke to my own therapist who recommended me a program  to recommend to the doctor for my brother.They do a more intensive follow-up for mental health adults that lasts 2 years and they work at the patient 's pace... My fear is he will give up or not accept the help even though he told me he is open to it last Sunday. Yesterday he started getting hesitant again saying he didn't want to do the work but also he is aware he needs to get better..

What my concerns are ; 
1.Basically I know that I have what it takes to help him and objectively he is better off with me that he is with my parents and since he has nowhere else to go I won't let him starve or end up on the steet. But, I want to know how to get past my  own emotions and fears and anxieties regarding this entire situation and NOT identify with his depression. 

2. I want to set healthy boundaries also where I don't get caught up in saving him because I already feel like I'm trying to do that... but I don't know what that would look like... should I give him a contract or make him sign a ""promise to himself "" what do I do if after a year he has not progressed ? Should there be ""consequences "" not punishments but, a different recommendation ? I don't want to end up taking care of.him forever I want him to heal with me and get back on his feet. 

3.Moreover,  I don't want his depression to trigger me and I don't want his negativity ( not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything ) to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset ( I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family ) ... It worries me because everything he says is a cognitive distortion and in life, as we know, you become the people you hang out with the most..
4 . I want him.to become more resilient, I am not expecting a cure but I want him to be processing in the right direction not the other way around.

5.  I also respect that he has a serious disease that needs medical attention and specialized / tailored follow-ups.  I want to be a good example to him...  one that is different from my parents.. He has become like them . Negative about everything on top of having severe psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite ( hence why I am am getting him to the doctor tomorrow ). 

6. He has been on antidepressants before but it wasn't good. He had more appetite but still didn't leave his room. Meds are not unknown to him. I believe tomorrow the doctors help will give us the best choices for him.

7. He is aware he is sick and even agrees he needs meds, we.watched a 50 min video by Dr. Sapolsky yesterday regarding how depression affects the brain and he realized just how affective depression is to the hypocampus etc... My brother knows he has congirive distortions most of the time. How do I keep him motivated to stay on track and improve slowly slowly day by day ? 

I guess in conclusion my biggest fear is that taking care of him gets me sick too ( I think it's a valid fear considering I am mentally fragile ans afraid of ending up depressed too )

DISCLAIMER: I don't want comments telling me he should be helped by someone else. He had nobody else and it is my pleasure to help him and be there for him forever. I just have legitimate concerns that I believe your tips and advice could help me navigate the situation better.

Any tips ?? 

Thank you so much,
Christina.

TLDR: come from an abusive home, made it out, somewhat okay trying to get my life back on track ans have been on track for a while so to speak but need advice helping me brother after he moved out of our abusive home, he has severe depression and psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite. I booked him an appointment with doctor for tomorrow but I need ripe on how to take on this responsibility without letting his negativity ( not shaming him as this is a symptom of his depression ) get to me and make me depressed too. How do I do this and maintains good mental health hygiene. How do I set boundaries ?

"Every day is unbearable ""TW""","For so long now I have been struggling with depression. I ended up in a psychiatric hospital a few years back due to multiple attempts of sui. Since then I have had therapy, I am aware that I have to be here, that I have to stay unhappy and that is what is most frustrating. 

Every single day from the moment I wake up, I want the day to be over with. I dread the cycle of the day starting again, being a parent to three kids is exhausting. I love them to the ends of the earth but I know full well that they deserve more than me, thankfully my partner is amazing. I can no longer settle in the nights, I used to watch a tv series or play a game or read but I cant focus on any of it. Life just feels so pointless. 

I feel like I am just forcing myself to go through the motions to keep everyone happy but I am not. I have tried so hard and for so long to get better. I've followed all the advice I've been given but yet im still here feeling like this.

Looking for success stories from adults who have been depressed most of their lives,"Hey. So, I’m 26 years old and really struggling at this moment. I’ve struggled since I was probably 4 or 5 at the latest, maybe even earlier than that, due to extreme isolation/neglect. I first tried to kill myself when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I’ve lived a very lonely life riddled with abuse, poverty, extreme trauma, and negligence. There’s not many bright spots.

I have PTSD, depression/anxiety, likely ADHD and who knows what else. I recently stopped medicating with marijuana, which I used for over 10 years. It’s brought up a lot of these shitty past feelings and reminded me why I needed to escape.

I’ve been in therapy with several handfuls of different therapists, tried several medications, and I do all of the usual shit like yoga, daily exercise, good sleep/diet etc. but I’m still completely miserable no matter how much I try to put a positive spin on things.

I’ve given myself until I’m 30 years old to feel some sense of normalcy or contentment, or else I am going to end my life, because I can’t continue on like this. I feel like that should be more than enough time to see if I have a shot at a decent life or not.

Has anyone else been this deep in the hole, and managed to get themselves out for more than just short periods at a time? I know life is full of ups and downs, but I’m tired of suffering 360/365 days out of the year (this might even be being generous). I’m really hoping someone out there has a similar background and has made a better life for themselves. I’d love to hear about it, in face I kind of need it right now.

In case it helps you help me to know this, I feel that I still suffer a lot from loneliness (I can’t own pets due to rent restrictions and I have trouble making friends despite constant efforts), and I have a lot of anxiety/pessimism around the state of the world, mostly environmental/economical. I think these are the big things holding me back, but there’s probably more.

Cheers, looking forward to hearing some hopefully positive stories.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Essential worker, trying to fix my depression nest.","My husband and I are essential workers, we've been working through the entire pandemic.

Finding the right psychologist,"I was seeing one who was great for the first 3 years and then started really pushing CBT and mindfulness onto me, despite me saying multiple times I hate both of those approaches and they don't work for me.

I don’t want to be here anymore,"

I am coming to the realization that I don’t want to live anymore. I am so miserable to be around. I honestly feel bad for the people around me because I’m so miserable. I am diagnosed with mood disordered n.o.s and generalized anxiety disorder. I’m graduating in a few months with a degree in Accounting. I will be going to grad school in the fall to get another degree in Accounting. I hope to take the uniform cpa exam. But here’s the catch. I suck at accounting. I don’t grasp the concepts all to well. I WANT to become a certified public accountant but I feel like I’m too dumb to pass the exam. I’m also afraid to go out and get a real job because I feel like I won’t perform and meet expectations and then I’ll get fired. I don’t know what to do with my life. Anyone on this subreddit have any uplifting words for me? I could really use it. I’m so utterly miserable. Every moment of the day I’m worrying about this exam. Without this certification I’ll never make good money. And everyone knows that without a good paying job you’ll be stuck having a shitty life.

"I just need some advice about my new psychiatrist, I am shocked","I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance?

Student Burnout and Losing Myself on Antidepressants.,"Hey, junior in high school here. The final stretch of this semester in an all-girls private school has been pretty exhausting, especially with the high standards they expect there. I'm currently and have been remotely learning for about a year in the pandemic and went on medication. Right now I just dropped down to 75 mg of Effexor due to feeling dead and totally unmotivated. My body feels like lead, my eyelids droop, and I just stare into outer space during my classes. I found myself struggling to pick up a pencil last week. I can't even look at my overdue assignments without feeling like I want to crawl back under my warm blankets and fall into a sweet, deep sleep. I declutter my space, eat, hydrate, and let a little sun in, but I'm still very fatigued and out of inspiration. Months ago I could barely take care of myself like that, so am I just impatient? Should I just ride it out and try my best with school? Seems like my only option right now. I want to feel like myself and WANT to get my passion back for my hobbies. All I do is school and after that is just endless consumption of media; scrolling on tiktok and instagram for hours. I'm tired of feeling empty. I don't want to go off of my meds since I want to subdue any overwhelming anxiety while learning how to drive and getting my first job this summer (vaccinated and taking precautions, of course). Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated.

Am I a wuss?,"So I've been living with my roommate/friend for like half a year. I think I'm a decent enough roommate (I clean up after myself, help out, blah blah blah). Anyway I was making dinner for us. She chopped up the pasta sauce ingredients and I made the sauce and pasta. So basically I used too much pasta for the amount of sauce I had. Honest mistake I think (tell me if I'm wrong please!). She got frustrated and lashes out. Essentially calling into question me as a man and as a cook. bottom line was I got hurt and ended up crying. Now this worries me for a few reasons. The last time I was too sensitive about being insulted was around the time I had a breakdown. Basically it felt like my emotions were sunburned and any little negative comment pushed me over. Also those kinds of things attacking my manhood and pretty much anything negative about me has been a sort of depression mantra when I'm upset (lots of negative thoughts rolling out at once). My question is this: is it possible I'm too easily triggered? Or maybe the particular subject matter was a significant trigger? Or maybe am I just a wuss and therefore not much of a man?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
Depression keeps getting worse and worse.,"Hey guys, I’m new to this sub and I’m seeking advice as well as motivation to keep pushing forward in life. I’m about to turn 20 and I need help. Everything had been stuck for months and I can’t move forward no matter how hard I try, I just get pushed down again. I take medication for it but nothing has worked long term. I’m starting to eat healthy and I’m trying to exercise more often but even getting the motivation for that is extremely challenging. I feel like my girlfriend doesn’t love me or care about me anymore and all I do is wake up and go to sleep depressed. I can’t hold a steady job, I can barely maintain a decent mood for more than an hour or even a half hour at a time. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, also known as BPD, and my therapists and psychologist both believe that this untreated mental illness is what is causing everything. I’ve faced numerous extremely traumatic events in my life that I have yet to accept/conquer and I really don’t know what I’m doing anymore. If anybody has anything I’m all ears because I’m all out of ideas. If you got this far, thanks for reading. I truly appreciate it.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
My partner doesn't take my mental health seriously,"I have depression, my partner of 5 years knows it well. Things are not going well with me in life. I used to do self harm before I started my treatment. I'm jobless and cannot afford therapy now, living with my toxic family and losing relatives to covid is taking a huge toll on my mental health.

I don't know what to do anymore. My partner is extremely rude and disrespectful towards my mental health. He never went to any session with me even after I asked him multiple times.

What do you do when everything makes you depressed?,"I literally cannot do anything anymore without becoming sad while doing it. I hate my job so that makes me depressed, I go to the gym everyday but I always end up hating myself by then end because everyone there is more attractive and fitter then me and ill always be ugly and fat and no one will love me, I go home to do homework and I end up depressed because I hate school, then I try to take my mind off things by playing a video game, watching a movie, or listening to music but even then I become depressed because I start to think about what a piece off garbage I am because I could never create anything like the things im enjoying. I cant hang out with my friends because eventually, they piss me off because while I love them to death, they can become very annoying and make me angry. I can't really meet new people because I am so afraid that people will not like me that I do not even try, which also screws up my dating life as well. But because of this isolation I put myself through, im very lonely. I used to hang out with a girl that did not make me sad but we are not on good terms anymore so I really have nothing to get me through the days anymore. The only thing keeping me from ending my life is that I do not want my death to be a burden on others, it feels selfish. I really do not know what to do anymore that can make me happy and it scares me so if anyone has any advice of any kind, I will take whatever you got.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

When searching for happiness my mind turns up a blank,"I am a 26 year old male, living a pretty normal life, I have a good job, still live with my parents.

That being said I still haven't figured out what I want to do with my life and feel like I have been living on autopilot for most of the recent years. I feel like I have been going through some form of depression since I was a teenager, nothing major but I certainly feel a lack of motivation, a dissatisfaction with myself, apathy, cynicism and anxiety.

Whenever I try to think about what I want to do with my life I just get a blank. 

Whenever I feel sad and try to think what would make me happy I also get a blank 

Lately I have been so dissatisfied with everything that I started asking myself, what world would I want to live in? where would I be happy? Unfortunately, I can't think of anything.

"My suicidal long-distance friend often does not respond to me for days and idk what to think about it, how can I help her?","So a few months ago I befriended a girl which whom I have a connection like with no one else. Unfortunately her mental health has been declining recently, she had a suicide attempt. I am extremely worried for her, last time we talked she told me I don't have to worry for her because she doesn't have the means to commit suicide, but it's still extremely worrying. I told her that I want to meet her, that I can come in a few months.

I texted her everyday but since a few weeks she rarely views my messages leaving them unread, despite her being online. She says that it's from anxiety and brain fog and I want to believe her, because being ignored is something I really don't like. That also of course makes me worried for her as fuck. I guess that calling her would probably be rude and will cause her discomfort?

I don't know if I can do anything for her? I wanted to support her with talking to her but right now I can't even do that. I don't have any contact to her family, and contacting them would probably make her upset.

How does one even find a will to live in this situation?,"I am completely and utterly lost as to how to justify continuing with my life. I live in a small town, I have no car, and I barely make enough money to afford rent even while working 6-7 days a week. 

I have no health insurance and I’m falling apart at 25 due to all the health issues I can’t afford to deal with or even get them properly diagnosed. 

My family despises me because I’m gay. I don’t even care about that anymore, but I have no lifelines to help with anything.

He won’t help me even though he makes 70k a year because I “don’t have the right mindset” but I don’t understand how my mindset could possibly be any different under the circumstances. I have been through every job in town and several out of town that I couldn’t even get to for very long, and the shitty job I have now is the best paying one. 

I don’t have the money or time to go to school, but that’s all anyone ever suggests. I’m not even at home 12 hours a week, yet I’m supposed to somehow get to a community college in another city for 16 hours a week, plus 30-40 hours of reading and homework?

Your experiences with Vortioxetine (Trintellix) or Tranylcypromine (Parnate) for Social Anxiety,"Your experiences with Vortioxetine (Trintellix) or Tranylcypromine (Parnate) for Social Anxiety

I would love to hear about your experiences with Trintellix and/or Parnate especially regarding social anxiety. 

I tried all the SSRIs and SNRIs as well as one MAOI and one tricyclic. No effects at all except sexual side effects. I also tried 3 talk therapies already (2 depth psychological and 1 behavioral Im doing right now). I want to have a crutch that helps me socializing and finally living life. I suffer too long from this shit and it comes with huge restrictions in life and life quality in general.

Is Trintillex worth a try if I didn‘t respond to SSRIs and SNRIs?

Which medication is best for social anxiety if any other than Trintellix or Parnate?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
I need help to better myself,"I am a 19 year old student at his first in person semester on campus. I am overweight, always tired, sleep deprived, unmotivated, and losing friends everyday. It has never been this hard for me to get out of bed, notice something positive in my life, or have fun doing things I enjoy like saxophone or long-boarding. 

I am stuck in an endless cycle of feeling unmotivated to do schoolwork, which makes me feel sad and hopeless. As I’m sad and hopeless, I have no motivation to do schoolwork. I have been trying different medications for a couple years and they really fluctuate. 

I just want to be able to look at myself in the mirror and not feel ashamed and disgusted for the things I’ve done and the person I am today.

My [23f] boyfriend [24m] has severe depression and I don't know what to do. Help,"For some context, I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year now. He told me early on that he has severe depression but he's working to get better. I have never personally dealt with mental illness before, at least not as severe as he has.

Needless to say, dating someone with severe mental illness is a lot of weight to bear, especially since I've never dealt with anything like it before. I do love him, but sometimes dating him is exhausting because I never know whether it's going to be a ""good day"" or a ""bad day"". Maybe he's bipolar, but I don't think he's diagnosed.

I've done everything I can to help him feel better when he has depressive episodes, but sometimes it feels like he doesn't tell me everything so I can't do much to help. When I try to help, he just acts hopeless, like nothing is going to get better.

I worry that this will spiral into unhealthy territory (maybe it has already). I've contemplated breaking up with him but I know it would destroy him - perhaps to the point of self harm or worse.

I think I'm severely depressed and I don't know how to fix it.,"First things first: I created this account because I don't feel comfortable using my regular one, and this is the first post I'm making with it, but I've been a Redditor for the better part of a decade.  Please don't hold my desire to remain anonymous against me.  Thank you.

Now that that's out of the way, here's why I'm posting:

I'm a 45-year-old guy and only now have realized that I'm just sitting around waiting to die.  Most people wouldn't know that by looking at me though, because on the surface I'm a happy, friendly, outgoing person, but on the inside I just feel empty and hopeless.  I can't sleep, I've overeaten to the point of morbid obesity, I have no friends, my relationship with my wife feels distant, I don't get out and go anywhere, I don't exercise, I have no career ambitions even though I have a steady job, and I just generally have given up on everything and I feel like I'm just going through the motions.

It's been like that for years.  I lost my dad in the '90s, my mom died 12 years ago, my father-in-law died a year after that, my brother has stopped speaking with me, I broke my leg a few years ago and it never healed back as well as I wish it had, I hurt all of the time, and my quality of life has plummeted.  I know I need to seek help, but I don't know how to go about it without feeling like a failure.  The idea of medication repulses me, and opening myself up to a total stranger seems like a non-starter, so I don't know what I should do.  As a result, I've done nothing, and my health is only getting worse.

If anyone has ever been in shoes like mine, how did you fix the problem?  What did you do to change?  How can I even get motivated to seek help and support when I can't even motivate myself to exercise, eat healthy, or talk about stuff like this with my wife?  I just feel like I'm surrounded by dead ends and all I can do is fake it until death finally solves my problems for me.  I promise though, that if anyone has suggestions that work and that won't have me cowering with fear, I will look into pursuing them.

Thank you very much for reading this far, for listening, and for caring to comment. &lt;3","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1
Can depression make you feel like you lost feelings for your partner?,"I was dating my bf for 1.5 years and both of us were deeply and truly in love with each other. I could tell. He suddenly said he lost feelings because of his depression and he tried to get them back but it never felt the same as it did before. Is it his depression that is making him feel this way or is it reality? 

He said that he doesn’t know how long it will take to fix himself and he doesn’t want me to wait for him because it isn’t fair for me. I love him and I’m willing to wait because his parents are the reason for his depression. When he moves out he will def feel that baggage left from his mind. He even hates them and is upset that he has to stay with them the whole summer before college. He even got drunk with alcohol because of his depression. And he never did this before. 

Do you think he actually lost feelings or that his feelings are being concealed because of the severe depression? He said he did love me before and a part of him still loves me now. But then I’m confused because he told me to move on because its not fair for me to wait. Like i really love him and that’s why im willing to wait. And he even said he doesn’t know about later (when he moves out) because he feels like he cannot be fixed at all. He said he is depressed to the point where nobody can fix him. He sounded extremely depressed which made me hurt because I wanted to see him happy.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I have tried everything, what else I can try?","Hi All,

I am chronically depressed, I feel that life is very hard, I feel suicidal and lonely. I have tried lots of antidepressants and many therapies (CBT, metacognitive, psychodynamic, you name it...) for many years. Over 26 years of attempts. I have tried also some alternative therapies too, like transcranial direct current stimulation, or some herbal medicines or supplements. Nothing worked. 

I think that I am left with few options like TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroconvulsive therapies or psychedelic compounds, like psilocybin or LSD.

I don't want to give up with life but I can't carry on like this.

Just so tired of being depressed,"Not really sure where to even start with this one...

I just find that the only reason I'm alive is simply because of my biological programming.  I haven't found any purpose to want to live, but the fundamental instinct to live is what's keeping me going.

I have isolated myself from pretty much everyone and I have no meaningful emotional connections with people.  I have never been emotionally or physically intimate with anyone and at this point I feel as though this is just the cards I've been dealt, that the idea of having a meaningful connection with another person is almost too unrealistic to expect.  I feel as though I've wasted my time on this planet spending it alone, but then I find myself equally unhappy when I am around people.  It seems like I'm incapable of enjoying my own company or the company of others.  I want to change this but whenever I open myself up to other people, it comes with emotional stress that I just don't know how to internalize.  I know that if I continue down this road I am almost certainly committing myself to a life of isolating misery or suicide.  I just don't know how to live any differently.

And because this has been a theme for me so long, its become a part of my identity in a way to be depressed like this.  It feels as though any attempt to change this underlying cause would be a betrayal to my true self or something.

I want to change things, I don't want to commit myself to a life of isolation and apathy.  I would like to have genuine and meaningful connections with people and feel like I have some sort of meaning in being alive..  But I just find that nothing makes me want to wake up the next morning.  There is no underlying passion for life, just the motions.  

I have been to more therapists and psychiatrists than I can count on my hands, I just don't know what to do anymore.

Apologize for the rant, this all just hitting me hard as of late.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

I feel like the things that should make me happy won’t.,"I’ve always liked video games, and always had the thought that not much in the real world really felt worth it or like it would do much for me, but a lot of the time even video games just feel like a distraction. Same with people. I can appreciate a lot of things, but don’t really expect them to fill me with much of a sense of joy or something. 

They say relationships are the biggest predictors of happiness, and even though I love my family I almost don’t know if I feel it. I just feel the pain at the thought of losing them or if they lost me.

It’s like I am only driven by moving away from pain and pleasure is fleeting if at all possible. Until recently I thought I was completely emotionally numb from medication but I’m trying to entertain the idea it’s OCD and depression that makes me like this, because that’s more fixable.

I feel like when thinking of hobbies, or jobs, or things to devote my life too I just ask myself but why would I do this over anything else?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Almost 20 years of social anxiety, how do I go on?","So I'm trying to get over social anxiety for almost 20 years now, 18 of them spent running around from one therapist to another and nothing helped. I'm going to another psychiatrist in a few days, and while I was the one to set the appointment I still feel there's no point. I tried CBT, pills, and was once arrested and voluntarily hospitalized for making a dangerous post. Is there anything specific I should say to the therapist? At this point they just send me to a different psychologist every time but I somehow manage to be too hard for them to get through to. I.E. one psychologist, every meeting, asked ""what are you thinking about"" as I was staring at the carpet waiting for them to speak, my answer was always simply: ""nothing"", as it really was nothing, I just shut off thought if there's no conversation, and it went like this until I got hospitalized where the psychologists in the hospital told me to stop making appointments with her. At any rate, 18 years of therapy, my social anxiety can probably be compared to selective mutism with how severe it is, what do I do?

Overall, I quit my job with no desire to find a new one, lost interest in most of my hobbies, lost interest in improving myself because it didn't make me feel better at the end (lost weight, listened to 40 books, tried out MMA, tried singing lessons, went to the gym, worked at a hotel to try and get my social anxiety solved, reconnected with old friends and then lost the connection with them after burning out.

I know of 0 people that went to therapy and claimed it helped them. Every single one that I asked said it's just a scam and at this point I can only agree, the success rate is just too low to justify wasting time on it, especially since I already wasted 18 years.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
I am close to snapping and destroying myself and everything around me,"I'm a patient person. I never lash out. I never once had a outburst of anger. I always directed that anger and shame into hating myself. I suspect that I might have quiet BPD , but I don't want to seem like an attention whore  trying to self-diagnose.

Where I live is hell. I do not feel understood by my therapist. I feel like all I do is fucking, WHINE, WHINE WHINE WHINE. 

I live with my grandparents. My grandpa has done some bad things to me. My grandmother is an cold abusive bitter shell of a women that points out EVERYTHING I do wrong. Nothing I do is good enough. ITs always the negatives. 

My mother is well. I don't know how the fuck to describe her. I use to idolize her as a cihld and used to feel special for being so close to her. Now I see how its fucking impossible to share my feelings and point of view with her because she just thinks I'm blaming her. 

My father left me with a child molester. And even laughed at me while I was crying, begging him to  care and give a shit. To at least PRETEND TO CARE. Nah he just laughed at me.

I have severe anxiety. I cannot do anything by myself. I am very dependent. I feel helpless. I also really  , really fucking hate myself.

People have told my parents how stubborn and rigid i was as a child and kept telling them how I was going to be a bad person as I got older and not support my parents. And everytime i'd do something wrong my parents would bring this up and it'd bring me so much anxiety its not even funny.

I impuslivly bought a pack of blades. I tried talking to my therapist yesterday and it just didn't feel like she cared. She just wanted mee to do DBT SKILLS AND THATS ALL SHE FUCKING TALKED ABOUT. NO ONE LISTENES TO ME. NO ONE GIVES A FUCKING SHIT.

What do I do for my partner experiencing an extended server depressive episode?,"My partner (24M) and I have been together for over 6 years. We both finished classes last May. I graduated in August and we moved back to our home state. When the pandemic hit, he had to stay at home for months.

He hasn't been able to finish his thesis or find the motivation to get a job. He sees a counselor once a week, has been trying out different medications, and even went to an outpatient program for about a week. Nothing has helped him in any substantial way.

He can only rarely leave our apartment, no longer gets to do the thing he was studying, which he loved, and constantly feels tired. He's such a wonderful person who doesn't deserve to be in a place like this. I don't know what to do. Every day it gets harder to watch.

how to explain my mental health situation to my professors,"I’ve recently been going through a really tough window of depression. I can barely do any of my schoolwork no matter how hard I try. I am slipping off the ball.

I’ve forgotten several assignments and I’m going to have to submit them late when I finish them. A few of my professors have even emailed me to ask where my work is (I go to a small university with small class sizes).

I also feel awful because it isn’t like I’ve submitted everything on time before this. I’ve submitted things late before, earlier on this semester. And at those times I always simply apologized for being late but I never offered any real explanations. I don’t think I can do that anymore though, since I’m now a repeat offender and my profs probably all think I’m extremely lazy and disorganized (they wouldn’t be entirely wrong).

I feel like I owe them an explanation and I really want to be forgiven for this. But I don’t know what I can say. The truth is that I know exactly how much work I have to do and I know that I should be doing it, but I just can’t make myself to 95% of it. I just feel pathetic.

What can I say to them to explain this? I don’t know how to be vulnerable and risk getting no understanding by telling them the truth. I mean how unprofessional is it to say “I’m sorry I didn’t submit the assignment. I spent the last week in bed trying not to die.”

But I also don’t want to make up some BS excuses either...

I’ve been feeling down lately,"Hello reddit. I don’t know if I’m lazy or depressed, but over the past few weeks I’ve been feeling empty. I feel so emotionally numb and I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy, like playing video games. I’m in high school, and I’m so overwhelmed by homework because of the pressure that I have to do them perfectly. So much that I just don’t want to do anything at all. My parents call me lazy, but I really don’t know if that’s true.

So I looked up what depression was, and I was like “yep, I probably have this”, but my mind is going back forth from thinking I’m depressed or faking it. It’s confusing because I’m still able to carry out tasks like chores, but at the same time I feel like I only do it because I have to. 

I also easily get upset over little things, like when my parents try to lecture me. It reminds me that I’m a failure. A bad child. And I’ll never be enough for anyone. Then I start beating myself up because of it, because that was my only coping mechanism. I would just punch my own arm or hand to release that energy. It hurts, but I don’t care.

I can still enjoy some things, like painting. But eventually that enjoyment goes away, and I go back to that feeling. I ruminate over past social interactions, and I just sit down and do nothing. I’ve always been tired and lacked energy, but I think it’s because I don’t get much sleep. But another thing is, I get hyper around my friends, which is why I have these conflicting thoughts about depression. Sometimes, I would unexpectedly start to fidget and do everything quickly, but that energy goes away when I’m alone. My mood goes up a but all those thoughts and feelings come back eventually.

I cannot afford therapy, nor want my parents to be involved. I’m not an adult yet either, but I feel like I need help. Does this sound like depression?

He said he has suicidal thoughts,"My boyfriend of 7 years and I recently broke up. He had been acting distant and cold for almost a year now. At first I thought he may be cheating or he simply just doesnt love me anymore. We started couples counseling together and he began opening up more and more. Things were great for about 6 months. Suddenly he just shut down again. But this time he was mean to me. He would say and do hurtful things. I didnt understand what was happening. 
He finally said he wasnt feeling himself. That he was a disappointment to everyone.   He admitted he would purposely say or do hurtful things to me. And that he didnt know why or how to stop. 
So he broke up w me and moved out. He said he loves me but that I dont deserve this. I now now he is struggling w depression. I believe it started about a year ago. But I didnt realize till a few months ago. I tried to help but he just keeps pushing me away. 
He finished moving his stuff out yesterday. I send him a text telling him how much I love him, what a great guy he is, that I forgive him. Most importantly explaining to him that all the hurtful things he said and did where not his fault. That's the thing about depression. It makes you act outside your character. I really wanted him to understand that his not a bad person. 

Anyway, he wrote back saying his just not ok. That he has even been having suicidal thoughts. It hurt so much to know he was feeling this bad. He promised he was going to seek professional help. Which is great. I hope he really does. But idk what to do with this information? He is a quite person. And it scares me that his thinking this way. Is there anything I can do?

My friend just told me she's been suicidal since last November. She has had fights with some friends and has distanced herself from the group. She then changed schools. She changed like a month ago. She says she made some friends.

But today she wrote a message and told me she's shaking because she was crying. I asked her why and she made me prommise not to tell my friends. And she told me that she's been wanting to kill herself. I never dealed with this so I dont know what to do. I wont tell anyone about it. I adviced her to tell a professional. I would always be by her side and do my bestto help her, but I cant replace proffesionals in any ways. she told me she's going to a psychologist. 

I told her that I loved her she's really special to me and told her the reasons why. She says that she knows and Im one of the reasons she's not commiting suicide. She also doesnt want her friends and family to be sad after she kills herself, and her granpa.

I dont know what to do. She cant kill herself. She's got a life to live.

I’ve been bullied my whole life and been depressed since I was around 14.

Should I keep checking in on a guy I dated for 4 months who disclosed he is depressed?,"I (F28) have been single for 5 years and I know what assholes guys can be. But this boy was something else. Intiative, social, funny but deep down sweet and sensitive. He told me that winter gets to him and after a month he was starting to show signs of not sleeping and e.g. told that he didn't leave the house during the week but to go to supermarket. I started to get worried when he suddenly cancelled our weekend plans, and I said that it would be nice to know if he didn't want to see me anymore. He replied immediately that it wasn't about that and I told him to concact me again when he's feeling better. After a week he contacted me and I decided to give him another change.

Then after a month he started to be again disconnected and finally I told him to come meet me and asked what's going on. He said that he has been feeling depressed for few years, but has now seeked for help. He hasn't told anyone else. I needed answers whether we had future together, which was maybe bad, since he had just come out of the depression closet for the first time ever... We decided that we wouldn't continue the dating. We both cried but I was pissed off due to the distant behavior that had been going on without excuses.

I have now been texting him once a week. I started to get worried when he was saying that he hasn't really seen friends or doing anything. He still doesn't want to see me, even tho he said that some day he will when he's feeling better. His replies started to get more short and take more time. Now he's not answering every time. I asked if I was bothering him and that I could stop, but he sid that it wasn't about that. I asked if I could send him a text once a week that he would just open. He didn't reply.

I have my own anxiety specially since we were dating and don't know whether I should keep texting him or not. There is mixed advice everywhere whether to not give up on a depressed or to give the person space.

Everyone around me has become so political and I feel suffocated by it.,"Hi. I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest and maybe reach out to some people for advice on how to handle this issue.

I feel like everything I see or is recommended to me across all media is something depressing and political and it’s like a hammer beating me over the head constantly. I honestly can’t take it anymore. Whether it’s watching tv, browsing Reddit, at work, even hanging out with friends playing tabletop I feel trapped and that I can’t escape.
I just don’t care and I never have nor will. I’m already an easily annoyed person.

It’s gotten to the point where I’d rather sit in my room drawing by myself or writing than interact with anyone because inevitably something politically charged will come up and more than likely make the situation awkward at best and outright hostile at worse. Even telling someone I don’t care about their politics is taken as a personal attack and I get blasted for being ignorant. It’s definitely hampering my willingness to interact with the world and my mental health.

Tl;dr how do I avoid being constantly exposed to depressing negative politics and people who are so consumed by it that they throw away any sort of human dignity? I need help.

P.S I imagine I’ll get some advice like limit my social media usage but, to be honest, I’m rarely on Twitter, I hardly ever use Reddit anymore because it always makes me sad, and I’ve never had a Facebook account.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
First-time depression,"Hi guys, it's my first time on reddit. I'm getting kinda depressed right now, mostly because of my disappointments. I put all my hopes and efforts into a competition and now that I failed my expectation (was expecting a second prize but got a consolation one). More ironically, my boyfriend got a first prize (which was kinda unbelievable and unprecedented in my school for the past 10 years). To make matters worse, he is entering university next year. Helping him with his academic profiles and scholarship applications made me really proud of him but concurrently self-pitiful. I feel a little inferior to him and constantly downplay myself without knowing how to stop. Both events struck me profoundly and I'm confused as to what to do. I think recently I'm suffering from depression since I have been haunted by self-harm and suicidal thoughts. I have yet to try committing suicide but actually harmed myself with a knife.

I think I may have been struggling with mild depression and anxiety on and off for many years,"When I was a teenager from maybe 14/15 years old onwards I struggled with poor self-esteem, low mood, lack of motivation, procrastination, guilt, insomnia and anxiety (about school work, my health and social situations). Back then I did a lot of wallowing and was pretty ""woe is me"". I didn't really have many hobbies or friends and spent a lot of time on the internet.

I'm 27 now and I've worked hard to get better at coping with things but I still find myself falling into the same patterns (though with a little less melodrama I like to think!).

Last year I got CBT for health anxiety and I found that really helpful. This isn't the first time I'd spoken to a doctor about my mental health but it's the first time I'd gotten treatment. What kind of surprised me though was one of the questionnaires I completed indicated I might have mild depression. This wasn't something we discussed and I'm left wondering now does that mean it's no big deal? 

I find my job pretty difficult because I'm constantly battling feelings of inadequacy, guilt, anxiety, low motivation and procrastination. It feels like *I* must be the problem as I felt similarly about my previous jobs as well.

So I'm just hoping there might be something I can do to overcome this? Has anyone dealt with something similar?

However, when we do talk, she tells me she loves me and how I was the only person she’s ever truly loved. She’ll call me “daddy” and fantasize about us having the cutest sleepovers.

Rant

  I probably think this way because as a child I watched my family overwork themselves, working multiple jobs to support me and my siblings, just to go home and be miserable. Mental illness kept them from being happy as a child, they never had the time to be happy as an adult, and being elderly is driving them to madness. My family has high expectations for me but I dont see the point. Its not like having a good job or money will make me happy. Mental illness has stolen my youth, ill overwork myself as an adult to eventually retire to a life of feeling that I wasted away.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
What to do when you notice yourself slipping back into depression?,"I've had depression from 2015-2017 but never went to therapy. It got better because of a good network of friends and living with someone who motivated and helped me get through it. Now I feel like I'm slipping back into old habits.

For context: I had covid last Christmas. Since then I struggle with fatigue, tiredness, lung problems and my thyroid. I haven't found a doctor that was able to help me yet. Everybody dismisses me because there is no cure for long covid symptoms. I got an asthma spray and thyroid medication but it doesnt help. It scares me so much. I tried to get back into fitness and train my lungs. Yesterday I couldn't even finish jogging for 1,5km. I'm 24, F, normal weight. 

I feel like a failure. Because I can't even run for such a short distance. Also I've been quarantining for the last two weeks and ate way too much. My medication also made me gain weight. I feel horrible in my body. And I feel weak because i can't fight it. My boyfriend always tells me I'm strong because I gave it a try but I can't accept that I'm chronically ill and suffer every day and there is nothing I can do about it.

It got so bad during the quarantine that I couldn't let him kiss me because I didn't feel like I deserved him. At the same time I want to hide how I feel because I'm scared he will get fed up if I'm depressed all the time. It's like a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I just want to lay in bed all day, I am scared to go back to work, I think about eating all the time and there isn't much I'm excited for because of covid.
Does anyone have advice how to get out of this lump and motivate myself? I want to fight it but the only thing that comes to mind is sports and I can't really do that physically.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
Ex broke up with me because he was depressed and said he still has feelings for me,"He and i were together for 1.5 years. He had depression since the beginning because of his psycho parents. His dad said he hates him and told him to die because of high medical expenses.

He said that he cannot be in a relationship because of his depression and said he probably will never fix himself because he is depressed to the point that he will never be fixed.

Since the beginning of our relationship he said he was dealing with depression.

He also said he will leave his parents house after the summer for college which made him upset. He wanted to leave as fast as possible.

He told me that his dad abused him in front of his extended family and nobody saved him. This made him extremely depressed.

He said rn is not the right time to be in a relationship and I completely understand why he is doing that.

He said that he still has feelings for me and that he will never be happy with me if he doesn’t love himself. I completely understand his stance and I gave him space.

1. Do you think he will come back? 
2.

Trouble with persistent fatigue- not medical,"Hey all, I am a 24F who has dealt with depression for about 9 years with varying severity. I am currently on Effexor after trying a bunch of meds and stable enough that I've held down a FT job for 3.5 years and now have a live-in partner. 

The details of my days, however, aren't great. I don't have energy or desire for hobbies beyond cooking dinner sometimes and watching an evening TV show with my boyfriend. I often find myself mentally exhausted and ready to shut down either at 5pm after work or later on around 8.30/9pm. It gets worse on days when I've struggled with negative thoughts. 

My partner doesn't really like how I go to bed early a lot, and is hurt that I dont want to stay up and spend time with him. I want to not always be so tired. After getting bloodwork done last week I know this is 100% psychological- my Dr. knew about my fatigue but said my results were great. I'd like to be the kind of person who goes to the gym or for a walk after work but I always feel too heavy and sad. 

I often don't want to be awake if I could just be asleep and escape feeling sad/ negative/ tired. What can I do to fix this? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

How do I help my depressed sister?,"My sister comes to me almost every night talking about how she is depressed because she has 0 friends and she can't make any friends no matter how hard she tries. Her other problems consist of being 18 and not even close to having a boyfriend (she has never had a boyfriend), being sick of school and wanting to skip getting her associates and getting straight to work, and she's also pretty self conscious of her body and her socially awkwardness in front of others. I am 16 and I truly cannot understand her issues. She talks to me for hours about her problems and when I try to give her advice she gets frustrated. I don't have any friends either, I am also socially awkward, and I also am very self conscious. We share all the same problems the only difference is that she cares way too much and I don't care at all. The advice I try to give her is to show her how and why she shouldn't care. I don't understand how she can care so much about these issues. I understand sometimes but it's not a constant battle for me, I eventually continue not caring about my issues and am happy again. I'm worried about her because she talks about wanting to kill herself and I'm the only person in our family she can talk to because she is afraid of making my parents more depressed than they are. 

My questions are: How do I go about caring for her? Should I just listen to her problems or should I advise her to care less?

I'm struggling,"I've always struggled with depression. It went away when I met my partner. I thought I had everything figured out.

It's not that I am not capable of making it go away. I'm sure I could try. It's that I do not want to let go of my dreams. I don't want to live another way, but I feel alone.

My parents think I am the issue,"Hello,
I am 30y woman and i am struggling with depression. Yesterday while i was helping my father he yelled at me in the most agreesive type, and got me informed that i need to be obedient, because i am not a 50 y like him. While i was driving, and he was constantly telling me i am a loser. And he always tells me that because i have no job, cause the pandemic, i have to do whatever they want because i cannot afford to pay. He told me that this is how he loves me (while being aggressive). I was so terrified and scared because we could cause an accident. While he does not have a driving license, he sais driving is simple and is for stupid ppl. And he treats me like i am a cab driver, telling me where to go... I asked him while driving and trying to focus on the road, why does he treat me like this. Always when i ask questions, no one answers. He constantly commands and yells at everyone in the house, and he always tries to proof that he knows shit.... I was terrified because he could smack me while i was driving. I went in a shock, while i was home, i cried so much, my self esteem is down. And something in me died yesterday. I am a good person and stayed out of trouble, worked. But even when i paid things in the house, or if i helped them constanlty, didn't matter je would treat me the same. Nothing satisfies him. All my life yelled and threatened me in various scenarios like school things, even if he didn't stayed with me and never involving in my after school homework, to pressuring me about exams and threaten me of i dont pass, i will end up being garbage man. He is so mediocre, no involvement but he is the bigger stupid mouth, no communication, no empathy. I am a small meaninglessness human being in his eyes.
Why is he fucking mean. I feel pain. I cry, i seek help. My mom does another shit thing. If i report to her what i did she victimises herself despite the fact she wasn't there, and what i say is simply my fault, because i need to shut up and execute.
Pretty much my entire life they did this. I feel scared, i have anxiety towards them, if i wont do something they will share with me their mean thoughts about me.

She Said I Can't Have What I Want,"I've been suffering from depression for a very quite a while, but it has gotten worse during this pandemic.  I've spent so much time alone, and my LTR ended as well.  I started with a new therapist about a month ago, because the one I had, though I liked her, kept rescheduling on me with very little notice.  I felt like she didn't find our sessions as much of a priority as other clients, because she told me that the person before me ran over time and there was no time for me.  Anyway, my therapist met with me today, and I have had a hard time connecting with her.  First, she did not believe that I was raised by narcissistic parents.  She felt it was my behaviors that were causing them to behave towards me the way they did and still do.  I've found I can't bring up family issues with her.  Today, I was feeling extremely depressed because I've been so danged lonely.  I can go days without saying a single, solitary word to a human being.  I crave human contact.  I told her I was feeling worthless, useless, and unloved.  I told her I was questioning why I was even here on this Earth since it didn't seem to matter one way or another.  She asked me what I wanted in this life.  I said I wanted to be loved and accepted by others (at least one special someone).  She told me that was the wrong thing to ask for.  I was being childish.  She said people are unreliable and will let you down.  I can't make them love me or accept me.  So I needed to think of something else.  This just increased my depression further.  I can't expect to be loved?  I shouldn't want to be accepted by others?  Can anyone explain this to me?  From all that I have learned, Love is a basic human need.  Love is essential to life.

I'm really depressed and I want to get help but I don't know what to do,"I have always known I was a little depressed, but once the pandemic hit all of the things I did to keep myself “normal” disappeared and I spiraled out of control. I got dismissed from my school a few months ago because I failed all of my classes for both 2020 semesters and most days don’t get out of bed. I have done absolutely nothing productive since getting dismissed because every time I try I get really emotional about the dismissal. I am really scared to go to the dentist because I know I haven’t been taking care of my teeth. It is a minor miracle if I shower more than once a week. I feel like life is just passing me by, every day I wake up and then blink and I’ve spent the past 12 hours in bed and I didn’t accomplish anything.   


All of my friends are extremely accomplished people with jobs or internships lined up and I have literally nothing because I can’t get myself to DO anything. I’m too ashamed to reach out to them about it, I also just feel like they wouldn’t understand or have any helpful advice. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I cannot help it. I don’t want to get into the details but I am also trying to process some traumatic things that happened to me in the past few years and some days I have are just dark. I am not suicidal but I do have some intrusive thoughts about suicide occasionally which are starting to become more frequent.

  
I am turning 25 soon and I want to get help before I get kicked off of my parent’s insurance. But I don’t know anything about what to do. Do I get a therapist? Psychiatrist? Or something else? How do I find one and how do I pick the right one? I had a bad experience with a therapist when I was younger which has put me off of this until now :/ Are there other steps I should be taking? I don’t even know what to do, I just know I can’t live like this anymore. Asking my parents for help directly about this is also not an option for me, at least not yet, which is also why I'm posting here.

i’m so sick of this shit (rant),"34yo female here. i’ve had major clinical depression for most of my life. i’m medicated. i do everything i can to keep on top of it. but it just comes back whenever it wants without any warning and knocks me out. i’m not suicidal BUT sometimes it’s so overwhelming to know that this is going to happen at random times for the rest of my life. it’s so exhausting. it makes me realize how tough people with depression are for fighting this off ALWAYS. but i’m struggling. i live alone. i have my animals (thank god) but i have no choice but to work. i can’t take time off because i need to pay my mortgage. my friends are understanding but don’t really get it. one friend just suggested i “plan a fun birthday party” to take my mind off of it and it honestly made me more depressed. then i felt selfish. i don’t want to randomly text my friends who are busy with their kids, jobs, etc just to say “i need help” because it feels like a burden. no matter how many times they say it’s not. i just feel like they say that and then roll their eyes to themselves like “oh here she goes again.” i have no *reason* to be depressed: i have a great job, home, family, friends, etc but my mind just goes insane and i suddenly can’t do anything. i can’t shower, barely feed myself, and just do the minimum amount of work to get by. i don’t even know what i’m looking for. i guess just people who also feel like this. like - numb. you’re not crying or angry. you’re just sitting there waiting for the day to end. i’ve been dealing with this for 25 years and i’m OVER IT. i just wish i at least had a warning when it was coming back. i’ll be on top of the world for weeks or months and then all of a sudden, the grounds knocked out from under me and i have no control over it whatsoever. then the guilt sets in “i should be cleaning my house.” “i should shower” “i should be working” etc. idk i’m just so fed up. not suicidal. just so fucking angry and exhausted.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

First time in forever.,"Hi. Hope everyone is well. Recently I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression disorder and anxiety disorder at the age of 18. I think I’ve always known I’d be struggling ever since I was about 15. Just a little context, 2020 was a weird year. I started off having the worst manic episode ever to a point where I lost 4 stones, considering i was already skinny. Then i got back on my feet, I was eating healthy and working out and even enjoying the air. Some things happened during that summer that traumatised my brain. It put me in a bad place as I went to college and was not enjoying it at all. I’m already seeing a therapist and it’s helped but it never feels like it majorly helped, it just feels like someone there to talk to. Now i’m here, with failed relationships in my family, no friends, horrible sleep pattern and constant pain. for the first time I feel hopeless. How do you recommend I get out of this lump and state (that I cant even get up to go get my prescription)? For the first time in forever I genuinely believe I cant help myself and i feel stuck. What do i do?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
I'm freaking out over the fact I'll never find someone and its making my depression worse,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've had depression since I was a kid and now I'm 26,   


So about me I'm 26, I'm back in college after being too depressed to function and failing a bunch of classes (failed one this semester as well) I'm a sober and recovering alcoholic (haven't had a drink since the last day of November) and I had ASD, ADHD for which I'm on medication, and I have depression. At this point the latter of which is pretty much killing me by inches and honestly I think its going to kill me before I'm 30, I've attempted suicide twice in the past but I failed and then two other times i was stopped in the planning stages.

But I'm really really really trying to be better, I'm back in college with a changed major to Compsci and biotech dual major and plan on trying to be a computer programmer, I'm learning to drive and getting my license, I'm looking for a new therapist, I'm over 4 months sober, I'm eating better and exercising,  I've signed up to volunteer at a food pantry, i ever gave blood and plan to again to help others and to help me get over a fear of needle. I'm really trying to be and get better, but its not working, I'm still depressed, Its still killing me slowly, hell the only reason I'm alive rn is I don't want to hurt my sister,

And now I'm freaking out that I know I'll never find love,  I'm 26, Bisexual, A virgin and my only real relationship ended on my 21st birthday when she broke up with me at a party and I was born on Valentine's day, I'm a recovering alcoholic, I live with my mom and brother, and I just feel like I'm too screwed up for anyone to ever love me, part of me literally is telling me that if I'm still alone and or a virign at 28 then its a sign that  I should just kill myself, same if I still live with my mom at that age.

I don't want to go through life alone, I want to fall in love and get married, I just honestly believe it will never happen. I don't blame other people, I don't blame women, I'm happy for people who are in a happy healthy relationships, I just don't want to be alone my whole life and I'm scared and depressed and I just don't know anymore.

I'm so tired,"This year's been shit, I just can't deal with it anymore. I've tried so hard to be strong and do everything i could to feel better but it's just gotten too much. 

Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world (that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed), but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldn't feel better, I'd sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what I've been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. 

In retrospect it's probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didn't. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I don't really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after it's been diagnosed, a complete mess. 

Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didn't exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldn't be going out. That's when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my family's health, but eventually I was sent in to school. 

Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. I've always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. 

I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. 

School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly weren't having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didn't feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didn't, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. 

My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didn't really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more. I got swarmed with homework again, having to finish two full art projects and some other things I forgot, but my family was going on a trip over the weekend (at this point I stopped fighting over quarantining it was clear they didn't listen to my concerns) so I wouldn't be able to work on it much. Everything just built up to this point where something as relatively small as having to finish a project just made me snap. The night before the trip I just freaked out, I was a mess of tears and slamming stuff around my room while packing. I remember cutting my finger, I don't know why it's just what I went too, I felt awful after it, it hurt a lot and while it calmed me down I just felt so embarassed and ashamed that I did it. That weekend everytime my finger brushed against something even slightly I just got reminded of what I did to myself, it was horrible. 

Sometime after or before, I have no idea really, something similar happened. I didn't do a couple of random spanish assignments in school and those appearently counted as quizes without us being told, causing my grade to drop to a solid 30 or 40. Again this was a pretty small problem that was cleared up shortly after but things built up so much that something like this was a breaking point. The night before a big spanish test that would either save or ruin my grade, I was completely overwhelmed again and just broke down, my mom was annoyed I was making noise that late and she kind of just aggressively told me to calm down a bunch but it only got worse. It just all felt so hopeless, but it was the first time in a while that I felt grounded in a way, that I ws actually there presently instead of just going through the motions, but the whole situation hurt. 

These downward spirals never really got better. Those were the worst examples but the time in between those was filled with me feeling a crushing sense of hopelessness and exhaustion constantly. I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me. This continued for months, I just felt awful constantly it felt like there was always something small that would show up and throw me off again. I remember another break down about two months ago when I was out seeing colleges, I just stayed up awake for hours one night crying to myself and venting to some friends. Something about how I tried to hard to have things be better, I spent so long trying to draw, and write and do everything that I enjoy while balancing school but it just wouldn't work, it kept getting worse instead of better. I was just tired, I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted to be happy but it only got worse. It felt like there was no reason for any of this, I was just here feeling like shit for no reason, I wanted it to end so badly. 

Around this time the school announced their full time in person plan, leaving my parents and me too fight about whether or not I should go back in to school. The same arguments happened and eventually I was sent in again. The first day back was some of the most intense anxiety I've ever felt, just pure feer and overwhelmingness about the very uncomfortable situation I was in. 

That leads me to now, the most recent random period of stress that makes me finally say I can't do this anymore. Three weeks ago review for the AP Lit exam started (a standardized test final for a literature class, known for being very poorly designed) and I realized our teacher taught my class next to nothing about literature the whole year and I was on my own to prepare. The whole overwhelming thing happened again, it just felt like my whole life would revolve around this pointless exam for about an entire month, leaving me with no time to do the few things that actually make me happy anymore. That night I went in the kitchen and just held a knife, I just sat on the floor crying for a while, I know I wouldn't do anything but the thought of it alone terrified me. I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldn't. I didn't think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said that's just life, there's always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldn't cope with that anymore, I couldn't cope with that awful reality. I just didn't enjoy living anymore, and if it's this bad now as only a highschooler I couldn't imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again I'd ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. 

Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT (another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast) in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I don't think that's happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges? I was tired, tired and done with dealing with this. 

So here I am a year later, lying in bed with no will or motivation to do anything else. Behind on my school work, and vastly unprepared for an SAT coming up in a few days, just wondering when will it be better. I don't want any of this anymore, I just want to sleep, I'm so tired of everything, I've been burnt out for months with no end in sight, why won't I feel better? I have a test for my driver's license coming up next week too, which cause me to again spiral and type all this, when does it end? Will I ever be just content with life? I'm tired of it all, why won't it get better? When will it end? Is there even a way to cope anymore?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
Trying to encourage a friend to seek help and need advice.,"So my friend has depression, we're in our 30's, and I do not know how to get him help. He's afraid of doctors, medication, alcohol. He has very bad social anxiety. He doesn't have strong from his family who are all pretty dismissive about this. He basically only has me and I'm not a professional by any means. 

When he gets depressed he starts shutting people out, I try not to push him to hard because I'm afraid he could possibly spiral. 

He's having a particularly bad few weeks recently and the last time things got really bad he shut everyone out for two years. He's put his life on hold for years because he's afraid and sad all the time. 

He needs help, I know he'll never seek it on his own, and I know it's very difficult for someone over the age of 18 to actually seek help but I need a place to start and I don't know where.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
A cry for help,"I live with abusive parents. I'm 18,  but unable to move out because the Covid situation is really bad in my country. Honestly all my hopes of staying alive were latched on to the fact that I'd be able to move out by the end of 2020. But things have been so bad, quarantine has given my parents the right to basically keep me under lock and key under the farce of 'protecting me'. They've broken the locks to the door of my room,  and often my father is physically abusive. Both my parents are emotionally abusive. Every time my father is done beating me up, for months  nobody in my family talks to me. I've suffered from a complete mental breakdown,  for a period of time I believed I was dead. I called a child helpline but I chickened out when they said they'd come over to my house to help me out. I talked to my school counsellor and she made me apologise to my parents for 'disrespecting' them enough to call a helpline against them. I genuinely cannot do this anymore. I haven't slept at night for weeks on end. Every time I try to sleep, I wake up suddenly and am unable to sleep again. I wrote down a suicide note yesterday. I made a reddit account today because I've the tiniest bit of hope left.

When to walk away..,"Hi, I (29F) have been seeing someone (29M) who suffers from depression and anxiety. Right now it seems like his depression has gotten worse where he has a low sex drive, sleeps all day, is gaining weight and has started smoking again. 

He's told me he wants to stop seeing me but when I ask him how come he just says he doesn't know or is overwhelmed/confused. And that he thinks he doesn't like me the way he thought he did when we first met. I've kind of tried to get him to elaborate but he said there's no point in evaluating it.

I was hurt but in the back of my head I can't help but think is he self sabotaging? Is this his depression that's overwhelming him and clouding his judgment?

I asked him if he was pushing me away because he didn't like me anymore or if he was too overwhelmed. He said he wasnt trying to push me away but that he's not well atm. I told him I cared about him and that I'll respect his boundaries and give him space for now. 
 
But after reading posts on this sub I'm even more confused, should I give him the space he says he wants or should I continue to try and be there for him physically and emotionally? Am I being naive? 

I suffer from depression and anxiety as well so I sympathize with him and from my own experience Im known to self sabotage. I'd want someone to fight for me and that's what I'm doing for him but idk how to tell if he truly wants me to fight for him or not.

How to tell my friends that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts?,"Trigger warning: suicide

(19F) This has been one of the lowest points of my life. I won’t go into details as to what is making me so depressed, but I realize that I really should talk about this with someone. For a while (about a week), I was actually set on committing suicide. I started planning it out in my head, was even planning out letters to write to everyone, but a part of me knew that this was the wrong decision. Even now, I’m about 50/50 on it. At this current moment my mind is more clear, so I just know that I should really tell my friends and get help before it gets to a point where I actually go through on it and start overthinking it again. 

I have 4 very close friends. We’ve been through a lot together and mental health is something we all take very seriously. While I am planning on seeing a counsellor, I just really need someone close to me to know what I’ve been going through. I’m not able to tell them in person due to covid restrictions, so it has to be either on call or through text. I just really need suggestions on to how to go about this without freaking them out and how to even initiate this conversation.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

What can I do at home if I'm trying to cut back on phone/internet usage? [Serious],"I am a single mom to an 11 year old boy with severe ADHD and Dyregulatory Mood Disruptive Disorder. We've lived alone for a year after living with my sister and brother-in-law since my kid was 1. I've gone from awesome to great to tired to bad to worse. My house is a disaster, my son walks all over me and is disrespectful, but he has a point: I either sit at my desk or lay in bed. In fact, I've gained a shit ton of weight this past year bc of the stress and depression. Physical activity is difficult, not to mention the lack of motivation.

On to the question: I've recently gone back on my antidepressants with the determination to stick through the side effects that only last a couple weeks (stomach pain, cramps, etc.), and I've come to realize that if I'm not staring at my computer for work, I'm staring at my phone. Don't get me wrong, my kid comes home and wants to play, I play... As long as I don't have to move too much. But, if I'm off work at 1 and he's not home til 3:30, what do I do? If he's out playing and I'm inside and it's 5pm (hours away from an acceptable bed time), what do I do? I feel like lately there are so many hours in the day and I just want them to pass.

So what do I do??","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Is this sexual assault?,"So when I was five, a group of guys who were inside my school (they all looked around 17 to me) circled me and one guy asked if my name was Thomas, he said his name was also Thomas (there was no way that they could have known my name, I had no friends and had never seen these guys before, and they honestly looked to old to go to my school) well they then asked “have you every touched yourself?” I said no and then one of the guys shoved his hands down his pants and started to jack off, they told me to try it to and I did. The same guy who knew my name asked if he wanted him to do it for me. I said no. My memory gets a little blurry but I remember the guys moving a bit closer to me there. I don’t know what happened next because my memory is completely gone. But I do remember that I told my parents small details of it and the next day at school about five or so adults came with me (I can’t remember if any of them were police) and they got some students out of class and asked if any of them did it. ( they were all in the last year of that school, and none of them looked even half the age of the guys who did it) so the people who did it were never caught.

Shortly after this incident, I suffered from extreme suicidal ideation, and a many times I even told my parents I was going to kill myself. I have also suffered from separation anxiety all my life since.

I am 16M now and only remembered this about a year ago. I am wondering if this is sexual assault. Or is it more, or less?

How do you pull yourself together when you're not motivated?,"Hello. I (23F) have tried to make a post to explain what's going on with me, but I just end up crying, and everything I write is incoherent, so. Sorry if there's not enough context?

I'm having a really difficult time right now. I can't really focus on work, and I don't get in as many hours as I should. I feel like I am letting people down. 

Existing is exhausting, and all I can do is waste time on my phone, because if I'm on my phone I don't have to think and time passes more quickly. 
I'm tired of spending hours on my phone instead of doing functional-people things, I'm just putting everything off and setting myself up for failure. But doing anything productive feels too daunting, and I don't know how to start? 

I want to develop healthy habits - spend less time on my phone, maybe go outside more often, go on walks, stick to my work schedule, find hobbies. Simple things that I know would improve my mental health.
But even though I want those things, I feel like I'm not motivated enough to make a change. It's always easier to stay in my comfort zone, to distract myself. My brain says I need to change, but I feel like I don't want it bad enough to actually try. 

I can't keep living like this, though. 

I've tried looking for advice online, but everything I see involves:
- Therapy, which I don't have money for. 
- Reaching out, but I have very few people I'm close with, and I don't feel comfortable talking about my mental health to any of them. 
- Self-help books and stuff, which just...does not work on me.
- Hobbies, but I don't really have any of those anymore? I've been depressed for so long, I've lost interest in the ones I used to have as a kid, and never developed new ones. 

So I guess I'm wondering/hoping you all might have some advice on how to get a bit better, something that doesn't involve the things I just mentioned ? 

I don't know. I wish wanting to get better was enough to spur me into action. Sorry if what I'm asking for doesn't exist, or if I wasn't very clear.

Depressed boyfriend left,"Last week my depressed boyfriend left me.  Even at the end he was telling me how much he loved me. And he was anguished with how much he felt made me suffer and how he thought I would be better off with someone who could give to me .  This is so hard for me to understand. I would’ve helped him in anyway possible and loved and supported him until the end of my days. Even if he couldn’t give back to me. 

He said I made him feel safe and loved and happier than anyone else. How can I make sense of this? I ask that you help me understand the perspective of a depressed person on this. It’s hard for me to understand why he would give up a source of comfort and love.

I love him so much and hate to think of him alone and in misery. And then I start to hate myself because I wonder if I was a better girlfriend  that I could have helped him and he would not leave me. The logical part of me says that I did everything I could but my heart doesn’t feel that way.  At the same time I loved him so much and he knew it.

"At 43 (M), depression is new to me and I don't know how to handle it.","I'm a married man, to a wonderful woman.  We love each other tons and consider each other our best friend.  We recently made a huge move across the country and for the first couple of years, my wife was so unhappy.  Despite having a couple of college friends in the area, as well as some of her family, she missed her parents, her job sucked, she just was miserable.  And this made me miserable, because the move was mostly my idea as jobs for me are more plentiful where we are.  But we've always had evenings and weekends and love our time together.  We go on day trips, check out restaurants, everything together.  

Then we both got new jobs and the world changed.  Suddenly, I was working from home and have been since early March, 2020, while she continues to go into work in healthcare.  Her new job is mentally stressful, but really great for her.  She's making friends with the women she works with, which would make me SO HAPPY... except now I'm the odd man out.  My day is:  make us breakfast, make her lunch, take her to work, come home and work from home, go pick her up from work, make dinner, do the dishes, etc.  Of COURSE she helps around the house.  Laundry, cat boxes, taking out trash, etc.  I'm not mentioning my chores to show an imbalance, just a monotony.  

A few weeks ago her work friends planned a get-together after work.  She mentioned that I should come by when they were almost done with dinner so I could grab a few drinks with everyone.  I parked the car and texted her that I was nearby.  She said, ""uh oh.  I don't think they wanted husbands/boyfriends here.""  So I drove all the way back home and realized something.  

I'm lonely and depressed.  

I knew I was down about working from home.  I'm a very outgoing person and need human interaction and it's been soul-crushing.  But once my wife had something with friends that didn't involve me, I realized that I have nothing but her.  I have no friends here, and haven't seen my co-workers face-to-face since early 2020.  I've met my wife's co-workers and have even been to a lunch with one or two of them and really enjoyed it.  But for some reason, they've lately wanted to do the ""girls dinner"" thing.  

My wife knows I'm down a bit.  She doesn't really know the extent.  I'm not suicidal, but I wouldn't mind not waking up one morning.  I can't tell her that because a) I don't want her to feel like it's her fault and b) she's very prone to depression herself, and the last thing I want is to spur her into a bout of it.  Having said that, I keep playing one thing in my mind and I'm worried it's going to make me resentful:  If the roles were reversed... say in 2019 when she was really depressed about our new situation, and some co-workers wanted to meet up for dinner with me, I wouldn't even THINK about doing it without her.  ""Hey honey!  I know you're crying because you hate your job and are questioning life, but I'm gonna go eat with the boys.""  Like... I can't even IMAGINE that thought process.  

Either way, I'm constantly on the verge of either sleeping or crying and I tried reaching out to a therapist in my network that I've spoken to before when this working from home stuff started bothering me and no one even has video appts. available until July.  Then again, I don't even know that therapy works for me.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

what would you guys do?,"27M from São Paulo, Brazil. I live with my mom, 53, and dad 88. Since 2012 he’s diagnosed with Parkinson’s and dementia. I struggle with depression since I was 15. mentally, I’m always judging and blaming me for not having a job, not have become a doctor, rich, so I could pay caregivers for him, and hire someone for helping my mom at home.
I’ve graduated in History. But where I live in currently there’s no job for teachers not to mention historian. I could tell all my story, but I’m not looking for apologies. I’m just desperate… I don’t want, I’m not mentally able to take care of him. I’m furious, frustrated and really angry to confront him sick. I fear to do him some harm if I get completely tired of things he is not blamed for (not being able to eat, go to bathroom and walk for himself).
I’m seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. But the meds are doing no good yet.
What would you guys do? If you really feel unable to get out of bed. If all you wanted was to sleep and don’t wake up ever again. To put some noise cancelling headphones in order not to even listen to his voice shouting all the time for help or moaning due to his illness?
Please… could someone help me? Send some piece of advice?

I'm a depressed mother.,"I have two kids. (3yo with autism and a 1yo lockdown baby) my eldest is a handful at times and has behaviour issues. My youngest just clings to me and is a very whiny child (she hasn't socialised much because of the pandemic). 

I am finding the pandemic hard to deal with. I'm alone. I have no friends to rely on. I don't leave the house. I have health issues, mental illness and I'm exhausted. I also have anxiety with going outside now which wasn't as bad before. 

My mum tries to help out, but she's also a full time carer for my stepdad with cancer. My other family are far away. To add, because I see my mum during the week, I don't like going out places incase I catch anything and pass it onto my stepdad because of his immune system being low. I don't want to take the risk. 

My husband tries his best but seeing me upset like this is hurting him. He can't (and I don't expect him to) keep up with a full time job, all the household tasks, as well as helping with the children just because I can't manage.

I feel like I'm struggling and there's nothing to help. I have done countless rounds of therapy, and all sorts of medication to no avail (only one was vaguely helpful and it just made me feel nothing rather than feeling sad). I'm still breastfeeding so not going back on meds just yet, I'm waiting til I've stopped feeding first. 

I just feel shit. I feel useless and a failure because I can't even manage to keep the house clean or wash the dishes up. It's so difficult at the moment.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Divorce and depression,"Hi everyone,

Please forgive any misspellings or run-ons.   Focus isnt one of my strong suits at the moment. 

This is my first post here so I appreciate any advice.   So I am at the beginning stages of divorce,  which is definitely making my depression worst.  I am sure I am about to name off items that people deal with daily or have gone through so please forgive me for redundancy.  We have a 3 year old daughter and we've been together for 7 to 8 years 9 (married 5 years).  Ive never in my life felt anything as soul crushing as this.  I can't sleep and even if I do I cant escape through my dreams because its all I dream about.   Im 35 years old and I have gone through heartbreaks throughout my years but nothing like this.   I don't know what to do...I dont want to hit the bottles cause I know that isnt healthy.  The thought of even dating down the road (when im ready) makes me sick.   I honestly want to die but dont have the balls to off myself.   Work is a struggle,  eating is a struggle, working out is a struggle...this might sound odd but right now I would love to trade places with a tree or just an object that has no feelings.... I dont really have friends,  me and family dont communicate,  I dont really have anyone thus why I am on here making a post.   I though I knew pain but I didnt.   Im really struggling,  this is the hardest thing in my life at the moment and i feel like my world has come crashing down.  Hell I probably cry 3-6 times a day, short spurts to long cries.

"Living in Israel, as of today.","Hi all, I’m David, 30, born and raised in Israel. In the central region.
This is the first time I write about my inner feelings, especially at these times outer war with Hamas in Gaza, and inner war with far-right Israeli-Arabs and Far-right Jews. 

I’m a happy person. Got a good job, great and supportive partner. I love living, curious on everything life has to offer. from baking, coffee, to movies and games, to travel and cultures around the world. I’m keeping myself healthy with vitamins and doing Tim Ferriss’ 4 Hour Body diet and exercises. Not watching too much public television and getting some news once-twice a day. Every day I’m working from 9 to 6, ending with some different relaxation daily.

For the last week, everything around me is changing.
It has started with the famous issues in Jerusalem, and later started to go south.

Sirens went off every evening, and woke us up every night between 1am and 3am, and also 7pm and 9pm. With every siren, we have 1:30min to get to a safe area. In that safe area, I’m meeting every neighbor that lives around me, some elderly, some couples, and young families, which the mothers are crying out loud from the pressure. Once 1:30min have passed, we wait for the missiles to get hit by our iron-dome, or unfortunately fall. 
Yesterday- one missile hit 5 kilometers from me.

While this missiles and hits in Gaza is going on - inside the country, in cities where Arabs and Jews living together - there’s literally an anarchy. If you look like a jew, orthodox mostly - you’ll get hit, kicked, and now will be shot. If you look like an arab, you’ll get hit, kicked, and probably be shot. There was not enough police to keep the area cool. Small groups (in their hundreds), are traveling to these cities to protect their people. Jews, Arabs, it doesn’t matter. synagogues burnt down, people being pull over and being hit by rocks. You need to identify in front of gangs if you are an arab or a jew. Either - you’ll be in grave danger. It needs ti be called a civil war non the less.

Back to me..
I’ve stopped relaxing, and listening to the news 24/7. 
We have an app for sirens so you won’t miss it. While the news are broadcasting 24/7 - we have alerts on screen for every city, and you wait to see if neighboring cities appear and you’ll be next.
I’m no longer using noise cancellation in my AirPods Pro so i won’t miss the sirens while i work. Keeping the windows open while we sleep.

And then I start to understand what PTSD is.
A car starts its engine, an ambulance, a police car, firefighters, a child starts to cry, a motorcycle drive through my streets, everything to me is starting to sound like a siren, and I’m always ready to run for safety.
My parents, my partner, my friends - all have that. Sometimes there are recorded sirens in the news and we mute it for a second to hear if it’s in our city or not.

Now for the depression. 
I fear to travel outside my city. From both people and missiles. I fear for the future of the people in my country.
I’ve canceled lots of plans. Today was the first day I moved the live news broadcasting to my iPad, and powered up my xbox to clear my mind. It lasted one hour..

I don’t know what to do while everything is going on other than listening to the news, stay safe, and buy foods for weeks so i won’t get out of my house.

How to tell my parents I think I’m depressed?,"So, I’m a 15 year old boy, and I truly believe I am depressed. I have looked at symptoms online and have thought about them and I do have some of them (at least I think so),and I at least want to get help and find out if I’ve just been sad or truly depressed. However, I don’t know how to tell my parents that I think I might be depressed.

So, a little backstory. My grades have been slipping this year, and I’m working hard to get them back up, but I’m worried that if I say something about my feelings now, my mom will think it’s an excuse for my bad grades (which it isn’t, i should have been able to keep up with my classes). I also don’t think she will believe me. I don’t think I can actually convince her to let me get a diagnosis. If any of you guys have ideas on how to tell my parents, I’d love to hear.

Here’s what I’ve been thinking of doing: sitting them down, telling them I’m not joking with what I’m about to say, and tell them how I’m feeling. But again, I don’t think my mom will believe no matter how hard I insist that I want help. So to reiterate, any ideas you guys may have on this are appreciated, and I want to hear your ideas.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Is this depression or something else?,"I noticed my bf had been acting off (kind of aloof and withdrawn) lately but every time I asked he said he was ok and just tired. Last night I asked again and he said he's ok but when he got home he told me that he doesn't feel right mentally like if something is off. He just wants to lock himself in his room all the time and he said it's been a few months like this but that he is just now noticing it. He said he has low sexual attraction and Isn't in the mood much and is disgusted with the thought of sex but still loves me but it's just more pure? 

Now he's had little bouts like this before and so I asked if it's like the other times and he said no that he feels just blank. It sounds a lot like depression but I am not sure. I've told him that he should go to the doctor/physiologist to get this checked in the past (I almost got him to go in the past but the office in his network in my town did not have any appointments until several months down the road which is crazy IMO) but he can be very stubborn on this. He usually gets out of them eventually but I get really worried and concerned for him and I don't want him to suffer with this. I wish I could just make it go away. 

I'm here because I need help in determining if this is depression or something else and asking for your advice on things we can do to get him help ( I'm going to try again for the doctor / phycologist but I know it's going to be difficult to get him to do this) practically and things he can start doing that can help him get out of this. 

Today I'm planning to get him out of the house and walk a nature trail (we like photography and stuff) and take photos and get him kinda grounded in a way. Idk if this will help but I'm willing to do anything.

Please I'd really love some insight and help.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Help with my wife's depression. Nothing is working.,"We are seeing a counselor and everything I know how to do to help her.

Today my wife spent 22+ hours asleep or just in bed. This is a new record. 

Her speech has slowed noticeably. 

I ask her what she's thinking and she responds, ""nothing."" or ""I don't know."" This in particular is frightening to me. I try to clarify. ""Is it hard to put into words? Do you not feel comfortable or safe telling me for some reason?"" She says that's not it. She just doesn't have any thoughts. This seems totally impossible to me. But I'm trusting that she's being honest. Is, for lack of a better word, literal ""thoughtlessness"" a symptom of depression that is documented somewhere I have yet to find?

Just looking to cast a wide net for experience here. Trying everything I can.

Leaving her alone doesn't work. Helping doesn't work.

Boyfriend has depression and I don't know how to help him.,"My(21f) partner(23m) has been depressed for a few years now but we got together only about 6 months ago.

Problem is that I'm struggling with my emotions. I have a lot more work on my plate than he does which irks him as he's been the academic topper all these years.

Morning depression and how to handle it.,"Hello everyone. This is my first post in this sub. 😁
I was wondering, does anyone have any methods or anything to make morning depression go away? I sleep and wake up at the same time every day so I don't think that there's any problem in that regard. I also do exercise and eat well but the symptoms don't let up.
I've seen that these can be symptoms of major depression but I don't know how could that be, since I feel pretty good the rest of the day. Maybe some days are worse than others but idk.

It hurts a lot. Every morning I'm scared of waking up since I know that anything will make me feel depressed. Oh you have online classes? How about thinking that you should drop out because you have zero motivation to do any schoolwork? 
You're watching a reality show? How about thinking that you are worthless and that you will never find a girlfriend since you're stuck in your house all day?

It's tiring to be feeling this way every morning, and what my therapist asks me is just at what time of the day do I get depressed so that he can find the cause. But the thing is, that cause can be literally anything.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

How to get myself moving again,"I’ve been suffering from severe depression for the last 18 months. Culminated in a suicide attempt back in December. After that I managed to get myself back on my feet after a while, started therapy and was working on a course I cared about.

Just under a month ago, I visited where I used to live to catch up with some friends etc. I felt ready for it. It was a mistake though and it threw me back into a severe depression. Actually my therapist believes I am suffering from PTSD and going back seems to being back a lot of negativity.

After 3 weeks of suicidal thoughts, sleeping 18 hours a day and just feeling awful... I’m feeling slightly better again, but still not back in a positive place. I’d like to get started again on my course and to begin to build back healthy habits. But I sit in front of my laptop and I’m really struggling to get myself to do anything at all. Are there any techniques I can use to begin to build up some motion? I know once things begin to move I’ll start to feel better again, and long term hopefully therapy and medication can fix this bind I’m in... but short term I’m struggling to take that first step. In every direction I look, things seem very difficult.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
"I’m 23, highly anxious, depressed, raised by a narcissist/alcoholic, and need a job. I have no clue what to do with myself.","


Until Covid I worked in retail/restaurants my whole life as I am extremely personable, albeit an introvert. Now with covid, I very much so do not trust Americans wholeheartedly, I’m getting the vaccine but everything is opening up at 100% no restrictions near me, which just makes no sense to me. Poor behavior amongst people these days, retail workers are the frontline of managing Covid and policies these days, for little pay. Now I don’t even want these jobs as I’ve not been social for over a year now. 

I did not go to college as I have learning disabilities. I also have awful fine motor skills, likely due to growing up anxious a lot due to alcohol in the house. Father has NEVER been abusive physically or frankly intentionally abusive, they’ve never processed any emotions so they’re a mess. Still live with them and constantly triggered by it. 

I also am sorta addicted to weed, as I believe I have PTSD at this point so I truly feel it’s a need not a want at this point which is frustrating. 

I could go on and on lol, so, help? I’m truly getting to the point it feels things just ain’t gonna work out for me, whole life has been out of my control. I was adopted, controlled by helicopter and anxious parents, now my anxiety runs my life, nothing is in my control or works out for me it seems.

I want to open up.,"I need to open up about this to someone, something, I dont give a fuck if its just a reddit page.

Im depressed. Im seeing some therapist, which I dont find very good. I cant trust her. She tries to put me on medication, I dont want that and ive made it clear. I dont wanna kill my brain cells. (thats what I feel antidepressants do, I tried some a few years back and it made me a zombie.) Ive had some other therapy in the past, some of which were good and some were completely shit. 

I drink to numb emotions. I dont even like to drink with other people, I enjoy drinking alone till I pass out. I dont drunk text, drunk call or usually do anything stupid while drunk. I do it 3-4 times a week. Its the only thing that helps me numb this constant pain and regret of being alive. Its been going on for +2 years. I cant give up that habit.

The constant ""theme"" in my life is that I cant run away from my emotions. Ive tried living in different countries, fitting in with different kind of people, anything that would like... get me settled down. I dont feel like I fit in anywhere. I dont think I need to feel like Ive made to someone or that like theres someone that would make me feel special. I think I just wanna fit in, somewhere, anywhere, howevere. To find - not really my people - but my place. Anywhere Ive gone, I get this feeling of new start, burying these old feelings of shame and not fitting in. And they just come back to me after a while. I dont know what to do with this. This constant loneliness and shame follows me. I dont know why, I dont know how to get rid of it. It is killing me. 

I enjoy being alone. I enjoy loneliness. I actually enjoy in some sick way to get let down by other people. Something I cant quite explain, but i think its cause ive been - well, used to it - also victimising myself and making myself feel like oh the poor little thing.  Then I get to wallow in selfpity and feel bad about myself. 

How do I get rid of this cycle?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
I don’t know what is happening,"First of all, hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this.

I’ve been dealing with a lot of stuff recently and I think I’ve done pretty good in regards how to deal with it but I still need some additional inspiration and/or advice or you know, just someone who will listen because my friends have been listening to this a lot and I don’t want to burden them with this any further.

I was dating a guy from January until pretty recently and we were always on the brink of getting serious when he decided to distance himself from me because I think he was scared or something (I don’t blame him) then in may I found out that I was pregnant 4w + 3 d when I found out and I told him.
He got extremely angry when I told him and that resulted in us having this really bad argument over if I should keep the baby or not and I was not budging because I thought it was in my best interest to keep the baby but then one thing led to another and I had a miscarriage the same day as I told him about the pregnancy and he seemed relieved that I had the miscarriage.
But then yesterday I told him that I had to stop seeing him because I met a guy who treats me better and what not (I hadn’t talked to the guy I had been seeing for a few weeks so I assumed that it was over) and he decides to tell me that he loves me (he worded it like this “even though it’s not in that way I love you and really care about you) and I told him that I love him as a friend and that I really care about him too, later on he proceeded to tell me that he regrets how he acted towards me when I was pregnant and he now sees that we could have co-parented well and that he wishes things wouldn’t have happened like they did.

I don’t know how to feel about this because when he brought up the miscarriage I started to feel like I did when it happened because I still want that baby even though it’s gone and I know I can never get it back.

Is it weird that I still want to be pregnant and is it weird that this chat of ours brought back the feelings that I had previously suppressed towards him? 
I can fully say that I love him in a romantic way but I still don’t want to be a waiting for someone that had to take this long and treat me like trash until he realised my worth.

zero motivation.,"I can't do anything no matter what i try. Literally, can't motivate myself to work, can't play video games, barely even have the energy to make this post and it's only bc i know some other people care about me. But life isn't fun. It hasn't been fun for a very long time. I don't know what the purpose of trying is because it never leads anywhere. people keep asking me how i ""know"" things won't be good but if i don't have a reason to do something in the first place why do i do it?

Doing things i don't want to do requires so much energy, never feels rewarding, and is just so painful. Sometimes it helps other people and that makes me happy. But I'm trying to live for myself and i literally can't because I guess every other human can just robotically perform physical actions without motivation. Small goals don't feel rewarding and holding myself accountable never helps because I don't know why i should care what even i think. I know that's silly but that's literally how empty i am. I can't speak or type or even stand up. I spend hours every day like this.  There's literally no reason to do anything. Antidepressants don't help.

How do I convince my parents to let me see a therapist?,"Basically, they are the religious/skeptical type, so they think God can cure my depression (if you believe in that all the power to you but didnt work for me and now I'm basically atheist, not trying to disrespect anybody though). And yeah, so they refuse to get me an actual therapist (for around 5 years now Ive had depression and they knew the whole time), I've self harmed, came close to committing suicide, starved myself a bit, and skipped tons of school over those 5 years. Still no help, even after I got school counselors involved in middle school, they barely did anything. 

But to give them credit, they somewhat tried to get help after I involved counselors from school, only since it was basically required. Except this person they chose to be my ""therapist"" was the pastor of a church I go to, and he invalided everything I felt, and even worse last summer he practically made fun of teens with depression and said it was just mood swings and it was fake.

Depressed person trying to support a depressed person,"I thought it would be easier to think of ways to help someone I know who is showing signs of depression because I too am depressed, but it’s actually so hard. I know ‘just being there’ is such a big part but I’m NOT “there” and can’t be, we live across the country from each other. 
How do I let someone know I’d be happy to talk to them as long as physically possible if they wanted to without it coming across as babying or OTT, because I truly would stay up for days talking to this person if they wanted, or even if they didn’t, I love them so much, I love talking to them and I think they’re such a cool person, and want to convey that without it coming across as mollycoddling.
They called me last night in the middle of the night whilst drunk, which they never do, and when I got in touch this morning they text saying they pressed the wrong button (not possible unless they’ve made no calls in the last two weeks, they would have had to search for my number and call me) and joked about being at a friend’s student halls this week and feeling so alienated, I’m worried about them. I told them to give me a call when they’re back home to tell me all about it but now I’m worried they’ll take that as me not wanting to talk now, which they might want to.

Dating someone with depression - help,"Hi,
This is a throwaway account.
I need some help and/or advice.

About a half a year ago I (32F) started dating someone (M42) absolutely amazing. 
We share interest, same humor, honesty have been there since the beginning, we can talk about anything, even shared deeply vulnerable stories and the sex is amazing as well. We seem to be able to connect in a way I've never tried before and create this space where it is just us. Green flags all the way. 
I quickly fell madly in love with him ofcourse. I shared my feelings for him about 4 months into it, told him no pressure at all since I wasnt ready for a full blown serious relationship and he didnt either. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me. Non. 

About 2 months ago he fell deep down into depression. He told me. I told him if there was anything I could do to help? He said maybe. I told him I was there if he needed to talk. He said thank you. 
Asked him if he wanted to meet up again soon? He said he was feeling so bad and was overwhelmed at work (he works a lot). I said no problem, you just write me when the time is better, no pressure and I'm not mad. Take your time. He said he would. 

Its been a month since that last text, and I haven't heard anything. My guts tell me to just wait, but I am worried and a little unsure of how to handle this situation.. Should I keep on waiting (I am not in a hurry and if I'm not going to continue my relationship with him I dont feel like dating at all right now) or should I reach out? (afraid of preassuring). 

Abandoning him is not an option. 

Please give me some advice or share if you have a similare story. I would love to hear from someone who has depression and who is dating someone who hasnt.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I need help finding coping mechanisms,"TW- suicide

For most of my life, i'd always been extremely suicidal. I won't go into detail about my life but it sucks and heavily contributed to me having depression and being suicidal since before I even became a teenager. A couple years ago, I had a failed suicide attempt and thanks to the help of some people I managed to actually develop a will to live and I finally got rid of the suicidal part, but I'm still struggling with the depression part.

When I was suicidal, it was really easy for me to handle mental breakdowns by just telling myself ""It's fine. I'll just kill myself, I don't have to worry about the future that much. If things get as bad as I'm fearing they're about to, I have an easy way out."" 

Now, whenever I have mental breakdowns I default to saying the same thing but then I start thinking ""Fuck. I don't want to die, I can't just kill myself. There's no way out of this."" and my mental breakdown continues and gets worse.

I'm really struggling with handling mental breakdowns. Even when I try to distract myself, either I fail to be distracted and keep overthinking, or it just pushes the breakdown further down the line and the moment I stop being distracted I fall back into the breakdown. I'm trying to stay away from substance abuse. It works, but I want to stay healthy and I have personal experience with the dangers of substance abuse. I've tried depression medication before but none of them really helped me much. I'm considering therapy, but I'm too anxious that revealing I used to be suicidal might make them worry I'm currently suicidal and result in a psych ward situation. I don't know what to do anymore to cope, google doesn't really help, it's hard.

A clarification just in case, I'm seriously not suicidal. I will not be killing myself. I don't need people spamming the comments telling me why I should stay alive, I just need help finding coping mechanisms please.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
How to come back?,"Around the middle of 2020, I had a huge mental breakdown like I never had in my life, isolated myself, move out of the city (for emotional and financial reasons), and shut down communication with my friends. Won’t tell the whole story here, as I already posted it, but after treatment and just passing time I’m now ready to go back to the city, but the idea of confronting my friends and their questions spikes my anxiety. It is obvious they’re going to ask WTF happened to me, why did I disappear, what have I been doing… and honestly I don’t know what the fuck am I going to do. Some of my closest friends were trying to reach me out while I was in the middle of my breakdown last year, and when I finally spoke to them and told them what happened they were understanding, but THEY ARE my closest friends. I feel like I can share ugly, intimate details with them. I don’t know if I can do that with other people. I can’t imagine myself being at a party or something and telling everyone I had a chill gap year (I wish). I can’t lie. And yet I want to not give a fuck about what other people think, I don’t want their opinions and their fake sympathy cause they never called, and will never call after this. I sometimes wish I was more of an asshole and straight tell them it’s none of their business and I don’t feel like talking about it with them, but that’s not me, although being honest the breakdown and the pandemic made more cold and bitter so I don’t know…
On the other hand, I wonder if some of them are mad because I gave zero explanations for my disappearance? Would you take it personally? Is that fair?

Do you have some words for me? I’d really appreciate it.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I am falling off track of everything,"I am 28 , graduated 5 months back and haven’t found a job yet . I have been rejected after multiple final rounds .

He talks about me to his friends, I don’t even know these people and when they come home , they literally know each and everything about me . And to add to this, I feel the need for someone to tell me that I am good enough but I don’t get it . I seek that from my father but he is just worried that if I will find a job or not .

I do have small spurts of self improvement, exercising mainly. Though it doesn't last long - month max.

On a somewhat unrelated note, when there's something productive ( academia/learning\*) I want to do, where some people would argue is a chore, ( I don't see it that way.. )  I occasionally find myself having a physical impulse like feeling when I'm trying to get myself to do something \*, the best way I can think of to describe it is anticipation during a reaction time test except with added sudden fatigue/tiredness. If I fight that intial feeling, I am abnormally tired throughout it.. it goes away when I stop..

Depression, anxiety &amp; eczema 

Highschool dropout 

Minimal job experience and huge lack of life experience

On going sleep schedule problems for the past 3+ years, basically done it all ( 24+hr days, waking up at 10pm etc ). I typically can sleep fine although from minimal experience ( due to inconsistenticy ) when I've had a normal sleep cycle, I have found myself unable to stop thinking - not always negative thoughts.

I'm often sitting at my computer 10hrs a day, which has caused bad blood flow &amp; weak muscles.. (nothing exercise cant help within a month ) Guessing here : I probably do 800&lt; steps a day .

I could use some help ;D,"It’s not what you know. But who you know.

Been ghosted after my 3rd interview. What makes it worse, is knowing who was hired (the industry is very connected online). Said other person had less experience and a worse degree than I. 

I must really suck at interviews or lack enthusiasm. All feedback I get is, “you were great, but we went with someone else” or “you lacked enthusiasm” when I smiled and did my best to be interested during the entire interview. 

The gaming industry is very altrustic. I’ve been stuck as a permatemp for a 1 year 7 months. I have a first degree and a lot of experience. Employers still don’t see my value and I don’t know what else to do. 

I’ve turned to alchohol to numb the pain, and its gotten to the point I don’t care if i’m fired and lose my job. I’m greatful for the opportunity, but i’m stuck, not learning anything new and I have been rejected from multiple opportunities at the company i’m currently at. I constantly aim yo better myself by asking for more experience, but i’m ignored. Then why am I kept and renewed contracts? Make it make sense. 

At this point, from my already non-existent self-esteem, i’ve concluded i’m unlikable, too honest and it’s not what I know, but who I don’t know. Alchohol is literally my best friend.

I’ve been really bad depressed for a really long time. Anxious, suicidal. A lot of abuse and mental illness here.

I had a lot of shit happen a month ago and I’m struggling to deal with it now. I went numb until recently because it was just too much. I almost killed myself on a Monday. Wednesday I found out my friend did kill himself. Sunday was the funeral. Monday I was raped by someone I thought was my friend. Tuesday my boyfriend kept making suicide jokes. Wednesday I broke up with him.

I cried over my friend’s passing. It hurts, I still get sad sometimes, but it’s out of my system for the most part. What isn’t out of my system is the rape. I didn’t realize it had happened until about a week ago. Like I knew factually we had sex and I felt like I cheated but I couldn’t really remember it. Then a week ago I told a friend what happened and he’s actually the one that pointed out uhhh that’s rape. And I was like oh...yeah.... I guess so.

Anyways I went numb after that but tonight that’s broken. I’ve cried so much for so long but I still just keep starting back up. I need to sleep because I have work tomorrow but I’m struggling with sleeping alone. The tv isn’t helping. I’m always exhausted after crying but I just can’t sleep.

I am having newfound thoughts of suicide,"My feelings have been getting progressively worse. I have had a complete personality change. I was seeing a therapist but don't feel she is a good fit and i couldn't work with their psychiatrist' strict appt schedule. Tomorrow I see a free counselor through my work. 

Let's talk about today.

I made a big mistake opening the wrong patients chart and I said some of that patients allergies. This is a HIPPA violation. Now I'm being flagged and face being fired over my mistake. I did verify patient info etc but thats not relevant.

If I get fired I'm fucking done. I find myself imagining slamming my car into a pole or a tree. I'm wondering what I will write to my kids in my suicide note. I just feel like dying. These feelings started recently, usually at night when I'm in bed alone. Now I'm in a busy doctors office, holed away in an empty exam room and trying to to burst in to tears. I fucking hate everything about my life. Nothing ever gets better. I've turned into a completely different person. Hyper sexual, I made a separate reddit account to post naked selfies and I've met up with strange men for unprotected sex. I'm do filled with rage. I used to think I was spiraling a drain, but that's not true anymore. 

This isn't all over this one mistake. It seems like everything in my life is one mistake after another.

I'm in that fucking drain. I'm in that drain, and there's no way out but down. I can't pull myself up. Everything else is pushing, pushing, pushing me down and I'm drowning.

I don't know what to do anymore. I desperately want to end this post by saying ""I don't want to die!"" But right now... I don't want to live.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
"My friends left me, whats wrong with me and how do I fix it?","So Im a teenager right now about to start my junior year of high school. I just want some help honestly, because no matter what I do, no one likes me. Im not sure why. I like to think that Im kind and nice or something, but it seems that a lot of people dont think that, or they'll say it and then take it back later somehow. I've been told I'm funny, and then later that I should stop making jokes because its not my thing. Its like Im interesting at first, Im funny, Im nice, Im as what my ex best friend described me as ""The best friend I always wished for."" But then a few months later she said that I was toxic and that I was lucky she was going to give me another chance because I could be a good friend when I wanted to be. Then a month after that, she apparently had to delete her discord, but from mutual friends I heard that she was still on there daily. Just recently she's messaged me asking to make contact again. I pretended to not see it, because honestly I really thought she was my best friend. I made animatic type videos of us together, so I basically drew us together hundreds of times. We did everything together as well. But I just cant understand what happend, why she just had the sudden change of mind that I wasn't a good friend anymore. Its not like we were in a fight or anything, it was just that I started talking too her less than we usually did {Our normal was like 3 hours a day because of covid, and then during this time it was more like 1 hour} I kept up my same upbeat and funny persona that I try to play, but she just... she left me. My other friend was a guy who hung out with us. After about a month of covid, he ghosted us and would only ever make contact by texting and/or commenting on things we made saying ""cringe"" or ""oh god..."" and then not responding after that. After about 6 months I got fed up with this so I wrote him a essay on how ghosting and making only rude comments isn't nice and that I was sort of hurt that he was doing this. He then responded, ""Oi calm down."" Too where I got more mad calling him out for the crap he's been doing, only to get the response, ""Cringe."" We eventually got into a call around the same time, too where he said that he didnt care about me and he ghosted me because he felt like it. A few months later, some of my friends wanted to inv him to a discord server, I was a little not that into it, but I felt that maybe he would be more mature and would be my friend again or smth dumb like that. After my friends had messaged him, he messaged me, ""Cringe."" I asked him, ""Dude what the hell."" Too where he said, ""Yknw its been a few months, I used too think that you were just a joke or a little game, but now your weird and kinda cringe."" Then blocking me. This all happend in about the same time in august 2020. I mean I dont know if Im being silly but it really really hurt me, and I dont wanna be on some kid on r/ Im14andthisisdeep. But no one wants to be my friend, after about a few months, its like our friendships have a expiration date. Its like from my perspective, I think their in the wrong. But what if Im wrong? What if Im just being ridiculous and Im really that bad like she said? I know this is really long and all but I've just been looking for some help I guess. Of course I've made other friends after this or tried to make contact with other kids that I've known previously, but Im always like the one person who you want to stop messaging you. Im the one that makes the paragraph, while getting a one word response. My mom's told me that I have a obnoxious personality, she doesn't know how she raised me to come out the way I did and that there's no wonder all my friends left me, and that when I go back to school I'm not ever going to have any friends. So the basic question Im wondering is just... whats wrong with me? I can never stay happy for more then a few days before I fall into this loop of self-pity remembering all of the memories that we had. I just want to know what to do. I mean obviously I cant get attached to people the way I have been until they prove themselves by actions, but in order to get people to stay, they have to want to stay. So how do I become better?

Meds not working for 10 years now!,"Hi, 38M here. I have been diagnosed with recurrent depression disorder. I have had a severe last decade - thrown out of jobs, out of relationships, had embarrassing public incidents and what not. Tried starting my own business just prior to the first COVID wave - had to wind down after an year. 

All this took a toll and I became even more depressed. Suicidal thoughts came along and my doc had to change meds thrice. I enrolled in a data science course ( somehow squeezed from my savings), and it kept me occupied for 3-4 months. However for the last two months I simply cannot concentrate on the lectures. As they get piled up, I get more and more tensed.

I am 95kgs, 5'8"". Had to move in with my parents after closing the business. Currently on Lithium 800, Desvenlafaxine 150 and Lamotrigine 100.

What should I do?

I'm a failure,"Hi everyone, I'm soon to be 19 years old 
My whole life I have not accomplished anything and have failed at everything

I have failed my final exam for elementary and had to stay for another year

Now I have just finish my highschool final exam and 100% I'm going to fail

In my country my final exam called SPM, u need to atleast get a C for Malay language and Sejarah ( history )

I'm bad at languages I have failed The Malay language in my entire life, and also in elementary I took Chinese lesson I also failed all of the exam that's in Chinese and Malay

I took extra class, study, speak that language and learn technique but no matter how hard I try I failed. Any languages I try to learn it doesn't go into my head 

When I was young, around 7-10ish in elementary school i stole a Lego robotic set. I was caught and got scolded badly by my father first time in my life
It was one of the worst memory that still stick with me throughout my life and always appear when I'm depressed

in my highschool years I cheated in my exam over and over because I have been trying for 9 years yet my Malay languages isn't improving so I started cheating in my exam in my final two years in highschool. I was caught and got embarrassed and got scolded by my teachers

I know what I did is totally wrong, then why did I do it? Truth is I don't know why I did it. Worst of all I already knew this would happen and I also know that cheating won't benefit me in any way. Also I tend to lie alot in my life, it has di e down alot but once in awhile I still do.

Now that highschool is finish and now waiting for the result of the final exam, I have been depressed for 4 years snd is building up and the space of hope is getting narrower. When the government announce the date of the final exam result I will drink two bottle of cough syrup . I have already attempt suicide 5 times, the worst one was an overdose of paracetamol, painkiller and random medicine 20-30+ in 20min. I felt Ill and nauseous for 2 weeks,I was hoping to passed away in my sleep but I only felt tired and no appetite. Second worst one is either drinking 6 litre of water in an hour or drinking a quarter of hair tonic bottle, I could go on because I vommited and it burned my throat. So on so forth

I have no interest in studying anymore, I'm not good at that. Everyone been pressuring me to get an A even though I can't get a C. My family doesn't have much money and is very strict, my father doesn't allow me to work, study first. I know that I will work a minimum wage job and I know he cares about me

The only upside about me is that I like to try things and get the experience, I tried many things from coding, stock, drop shipping, making my own face cream, cooking, farming, exercise etc. I'm more interested in those type of things than studying but I know none of those things matter if I don't have any capital so to get capital I need a job or win lottery somehow. Also I like writing suicide notes :(

I'm an idiot I know that, guy that can't even passed my highschool exam. Guy that doesn't learn from previous mistake. 

I've been suicidal this year because everything is going downhill. I have just started stock trading recently with 800 dollar and I have lost 500 dollar already. Last month I was able to make atleast 20dollar perday for 2week for  now I have been losing 20 dollar a day around that amount. My family having less money, my sister have college dept, I know that I won't passed my highschool now I'm just waiting for the announcement of the result.

I have never been this depressed before In my life, everything anything I do it doesn't seem to have any result anymore, dropship can't make a single money,, I don't have any motivation to code forgetting every thing about it, trading now left with 280 dollar. 

Knowing that I can't do anything and I have been a disappointment in my life, I think is better if I'm not here I won't be able to accomplish anything

I stopped exercise because Everytime I do, all the bad memories keep appearing out in my head. Making me less motivated to exercise

I lost so much money in stock now I'm even more scared to put any amount in it

I can't work right now because my father don't allow and is covid . I don't even know if I can get a job at all.

I have been a failure in my life 
I tried changing but I didn't get any result
I don't know if I have any mental illness like dyslexia so that's why I can't seem to learn any languages but it doesn't matter anymore

I can't seem to be able to do anything
I've been so depressed I just want to sleep all day. 
My dreams have become more lucid I feel nice in my dream.

I want to call suicidal hotline but I'm worried that the police will be involved 

I'm a failure in everything whatever I do or touch it break apart

I been crying everyday, I tried improving myself
I'm not stable I been in my room lying down looking at stock all day but whenever I see a 1 percent loss I get even more scared
I don't want to do anything anymore I'm too afraid
I'm very close too suicide


Please help I really don't know what to do with my life anymore
I can't do this
I'm just holding onto a small thin string the moment they announce when final exam result will bethe string will snap
I don't want to see my result and I don't want to go through failing and disappointment look from my family
Before the exam my family told me you better passed, now that I know I won't I really don't want to see that day coming
Do I still want to live 98% no
I'm not as strong as last year I can still handle few losses and failure 
But now everything just collapse Im in gear of losing I'm in fear of embarrassment im in fear of failure and not being able to accomplish anything

Before my depression was this strong I always told myself to be successful is not a straight road there will be up and down and you may fail many time before u succeed. 

I stick by it until I finish my final exam 
Now My past bad memories has been appearing in my Head every second I can't stop thinking about it knowing how much of an idiot and failure I am
I have not finished anything I have not gained a single thing.

I can't do it anymore :(
Nothing is being done I'm not learning anything now
I'm learning useless thing now like saying ABCD in opposite way ZYX

I used to be someone who likes learning new things everyday but now it just stopped because I know that my suicide date is nearing everything seems useless and I couldn't get anything accomplish","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1
Don't understand my depression,"28 year old male here.

I'm having a bit of trouble expressing what my depression really is. To my therapist, my psychiatrist, my long-term boyfriend, hell even to myself.

I don't want to kill myself, I don't want to die, I just want to not be... me. 

My self-esteem and confidence is zero, but I put on a happy face. Unfortunately I'm funny, so when I finally express how I'm really feeling it always comes at a shock.

I can't take pictures of myself, I can barely look in the mirror, because I hate what I see. I was required to submit a picture of myself for university and literally had a panic attack.

I always give seemingly-accurate reasons about not posting anything on social media, and I finally came clean to my boyfriend that every reason I don't is because I can't stand myself, and to be honest, I don't think he understood. He's always been supportive of me and helping me get the help I need, but I don't think he is able to empathize rather than sympathize.

I have this self-disgust and self-hatred. I don't want to see myself in pain or hurt myself, I just don't want to see myself. 

I'm conflicted because one side of my brain I am able to logic my way out of some spiraling thoughts...  (thanks CBT therapy) but the other is just so dark and unforgiving and unrelenting. 

I thought my meds were working, and I think they are. I think they finally allowed me to see this a bit clearer, but I've really struggling since.

The thing is - **I want to get better**. I want to be okay, and I just don't know how.

Anyone have any direction or thinks to think about?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

there's no point in life if i can't sustain attention to enjoy it,"thought it was depression. idk, maybe it is. but if it's adhd, then i don't want to live anymore. i've had enough of life. life has given me countless traumas from the day i was born. an abusive father who did things ranging from yelling at me for crying as a baby (my earliest memory) to almost terminating my life a few times to asking me for money after all that. i'm poor and had such an unfulfilled childhood bc it was wasted away in front of the tv bc my mom could not afford anything for me. high school was wasted away in front of textbooks. almost all of grade school was a dessert of social interaction–– almost nobody could be friends with me. 

but now, i might have a permanent condition that will never, ever go away? that will stick with me my entire life?

this is kind of the last straw for me...? what's the point if i can't fix any of my own flaws? what's the point of life if i can't sustain the attention to enjoy anything? i won't be able to sustain any hobbies, pay attention through movies, keep any lasting friendships bc i can't understand social interaction, or show my family that i care about them bc i'll always forget their birthdays. i'll never succeed, i'll never be good at life. i'll always be bored. nothing will ever be enough for me. i'll always be thought of as a weirdo, bc it turned out i was a weirdo the whole time. this was it. this is what turned others off from me the whole time. i thought it was the stuff like flinching from being hit. now this is just another added layer. i'll never be able to keep up in conversations, to 'look like' i'm paying attention, i'll never know humor or jokes bc i'm too late to them. all the joys in life, everything that i thought was worth living to see in life, is now gone, because my brain is abnormal and incapable.

i feel disgusting. i feel inadequate. i feel like a total idiot, not knowing i was really just born with a faulty brain the whole time. i feel so incapable and trapped. i'll never, ever be happy, because this is not fixable. there is truly no point anymore, because i cannot find a reason for living beyond joy? why live if your brain is going to force you to be bored your whole life, bc it thinks nothing is interesting? i hate this.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
"No appetite, suggestions?","Hiii and thanks in advance for any advice here. I struggle even wanting to talk about it because my family members are all I have, and they all 3 have binge eating habits. I feel guilty about it so please be gentle with me. 
About 4 or 5 years ago when my mental health started taking a nose dive I noticed I started losing my appetite. I started to fluctuate around 20-30 lbs throughout these years. I have no trouble continuing to drink. I’ve mentioned it to my doctors but they have never elaborated on it with me, and I have had blood drawn a few times, making it seem like it’s not as much of a problem. But it’s getting worse, no matter what food I prepare or go pick up I can only eat a few bites before I can’t even chew it anymore and have to put it away. And I only do that 1-2 times a day. It’s really starting to get to me. 
Does anyone here also go through this? I’ve thought about some kind of protein drink for when I’m on the brink of passing out. But have never looked into that stuff and I feel so overwhelmed with this right now. I don’t have a job at the moment and can’t afford to try a bunch of high priced options.

starting around age 12 (or maybe before but that’s the age i can remember thinking ab this stuff) i’ve been a very quiet and reserved person, never really tried to make new friends. i’ve always been liked by people though for whatever reason, so i’ve been friends with plenty of different people and different types of people. 

but i don’t have a group of people who i feel like i can connect to. i feel like most of my friendships are relatively surface-level, especially when i see others around me who are all really close. now i know it’s not good to compare myself to other people, but i can’t help doing it, it’s something my mind just does on its own. i am a naturally jealous person :( 

one of the few people who i would consider closer than the rest of the people i talk to invited me to a discord server with a few people he knows (irl) and they all just seem to get along so well and have a real connection, but i basically never speak there. i feel so distanced. this same friend also keeps telling me about a girl who is a very close friend of his, and the stuff he tells me about just makes it seem like they really care about eachother. it’s obviously not intentional and i’m not mad about it, but it feels like a slap in the face because i have such a hard time forming relationships with people. 

i always feel bad when i feel this way too. like, i 100% recognize how lucky i am that so many people have taken a liking to me, when so many others like me didn’t get that privilege. but i feel like it’s never enough for me. i feel so selfish. 

i don’t even know why i’m writing this. i guess it’s some kind of cry for help? but whenever i write something like this i always look back and feel like i’ve done nothing but whine like a little bitch, and that if i actually tried to talk to anyone instead of crying on reddit i  may actually be able to make good friends. i don’t know. i really wish i did. any comments are appreciated. thank you for reading ❤️","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Does anyone struggle with figuring out whether you're depressed or just struggling?? And pulling yourself out of a deep depression? TW!,"Life's not going good for me and I'm realizing now that I may have been in a deep depression and not even realized it. I've been depressed before and realized it but this seems different. I've had good days and bad days but everyday it seems like I always drop to a deep low everyday. Idk if I'm depressed or just over thinking it.

I can't get myself to be happy. I'll find little moments of joy and some days I'm in a really good mood but then always seem to drop down. Like I'll be having a good day and then it feels like the floor crumbled under me and now I'm so low that I can't see light. I just don't feel good.

 I've put up these many walls to keep emotions and feelings away because of my new job, home responsibilities and marriage responsibilities. I've pent up so much that I can't even seem to cry. I've tried but after like  minute it just shuts off. Like I can't get myself to cry.

I'm at a lose and don't know what to do. I keep telling myself things will turn out OK but I just want to stop existing.  Like I don't necessarily want to die but I also don't want to live. And this has been a consistent for months. I feel like I've been in a deep depression and I can't seem to pull myself out. But again idk.

How do I tell when I am and how do I pull myself out?

How to get brave enough to kill yourself,"PLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency. (TLDR; self hate, worthlessness, getting over fear of death.)  


  

I’m just so tired of living. 

I’ve always hated myself and people since a very early age and I cannot trust anyone. I feel absolutely wrong in this world. Everything I do or say or think is wrong. Since day one I was wrong. I can’t do anything right (like honestly not trying to exaggerate here) and can’t make any connections with anyone. I’m actually unable to feel love or compassion or any sort of human connection. (Don’t even get me started on sex) I’m sick of watching everyone else get what I can’t have. I don’t deserve love or kindness and I’m honestly sick of being the brunt of a very boring joke. I feel like the universe is constantly telling me I don’t belong here; I also feel like I’m not THAT important to have the universe specifically pick on me. My role in this world is to be unremarkable and useless. I only see evil in the world, I can see no kindness. As long as there is man (\*men), there can be on peace. Since the dawn of time we’ve chosen violence, death and hate. Even in the 21st century we still are starting wars, having genocides and famine and humans are becoming less and less human… (or more human??) I can’t hold onto friendships or make any solid connections. I can only make friend with people who need someone’s shoulder to cry on and once they’re done with me, they’re gone. I also cling onto anyone that stays remotely too long and then feel utterly betrayed by the smallest problem they face me with. I freak out at the smallest things like dropping a spoon or having a giant mess. I used to be able to pretend to be happy and healthy and human but, as usual, I can’t do that right so I’m slipping. 

I can’t stay at a job for longer than a year without freaking out. I work at a job I’ve wanted for so long but see how little work or care is actually put in by my fellow coworkers and its maddening. They say we’re a team and all here for each other, but threaten my job when I have a bad mental health day and couldn’t care less (or only pretend to care so they get goss) I have the most amazing best friend but I do not deserve to be friends with them. They’re the only person to make me feel almost heard and accepted, sticking through all the real bad times, but I know they’re too good for me and its only a matter of time before I push them away with my bullshit. I’m constantly talking about killing myself but I’m too much of a fucking pussy to do it. I only have myself in this world and that absolutely the worst possible thing I can have. For as much hate as I have for other people, I have just a tiny bit more for myself. The only person to ever love me is dead, and even then I wasn’t enough for them. (Can argue their lives would’ve been well worth more without my birth) I’m just constantly fighting with myself and the demons in my head and I’m just s sick of feeling like this. I have no family, no kids, no property and barely enough money to keep me afloat. I’m usually an organized person but my place has hit a new level of depression and I’m sick of looking at it all but too lazy to clean up. I’m anxious 24/7. I’m so sick of being ungrateful and a fucking spoiled 1st world valley girl who’s never had hardships. I have no hope that I’ll ever get better. I feel like I want to be miserable. I have so much passion and it goes unheard or unwanted and I’m watching the world literally falling apart and no one gives a flying fuck. The planet is dying and people only care about going to parties and being stupid cunts who then mindlessly breed and treat their kids as toys. Everyone is just getting more narcissistic and its honestly terrifying. Especially seeing how the world responded to Covid (Mostly the US) and watching everyone bitch and moan how they can’t go out or get haircuts while THOUSDANDS of people are dying is just so fucking disgusting. Humans have outstayed their welcome &amp; I honestly cant wait for the end of the human race. 

I have no interest in anything anymore and even if I did, like drawing, I immediately remind myself how pointless it is. I’ve been drawing for a good chunk of my life and seeing children so far ahead of me in development and skill just makes me realize how I’ve wasted my time on something so trivial. I have no messages or any grand ideas to out into the world. No one wants to see shit from a dumb ass white girl from LA. (Well, a dumb ass ugly white girl) I love animals but can’t take care of them for shit &amp; I feel like I’m always failing them. Humans do nothing but slay and enslave animals and we don’t care how many have to go extinct as long as we get fancy things. I’m taking up way too much space and resources. I could be happy and free by now; sell all my shit and travel the world before kicking the bucket but instead I choose to run the rat race, get that tiny slice of bread and do what every other human does. I’m too scared to do it (but getting closer I think!!) so this is what I deserve. I have shit planned like trusts/wills and how I’d do it but I don’t deserve peace. I can’t even say really why I’m coming to the internet for advice when I know exactly how it’ll turn out. (Get maybe a few replies, mostly being trolls and the rest being a generic ‘it’ll get better!’ crap) I feel just wrong in this person suit that was not tailor made for me and there’s no way of getting out except death. So I guess just any advice on how to better deal with being a worthless loser, how to hold up that smile so you don’t make anyone else uncomfortable (Or just changing yourself completely) and how to ultimately gain confidence to fucking do what I’ve wanted since middle school.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

I feel hopelessly inferior to everyone around me,"It's like there is the level of common understanding or thought that everyone else has but me. It's really hard to put into words because its just a feeling i get when i am outside, or seeing videos on the internet. It's like other people know what to say or how to act in situations i'm utterly lost in. 

And I also feel inferior because everyone else has so much experience and i havent had any. I feel like a sheltered baby compared to just my peers. They hook up, they smoke/take drugs, go to bars and parties. I dont do any of that, still a fucking virgin. And when conversations inevitably get around to those topics, i feel terrible. I feel inferior, ashamed of myself, and lots guilt and self loathing. I think part of the guilt and self loathing comes from one of my initial reactions being hatred. I dont want to hate them, that doesnt make any sense because i want to be like them and theyre just living their best lives. But i do feel hatred because they not only get to casually do what i have cried myself to sleep wishing i could do. And then i turn that on myself. ""I shouldnt hate them, im a terrible person for thinking that. Thinking that makes you an incel/neckbeard/creep"". 

Its so grating to my ears to hear my neighbor having friends over or parties, or to hear people walking by outside on their way to a party or even just get some food. And i makes me want to slam my head.

I know i can never get better if i think like this. But i'll probably just never get better, period. Because i suck at socializing. I dont get invited to things. I dont have anyone to invite to get something going myself. I suck. Worthless, sack of shit.

How to get over feeling like a disappointment and failure?,"I graduated from university about a month ago with a degree in acting and creative writing. Always was told to pursue my passions, so I did, and I was extremely pleased with my college career. I performed every single semester I was in school and wrote so. Much. Stuff I am so proud of. 

But now that I'm out of school I feel like a disappointment. My family is supportive of my choice in study but it feels like they're scared I'm not going to have a career or get a job with my degree, that I'll always be in financial trouble and live the life of the starving artist. My brother got extremely lucky with opportunities coming out of college studying business and he's pretty much set now for life, and I can't help but feel like I've let my family down. Never has my brother been pervaded with the number of, 'what if...', 'what will you do....', 'backup plans...' 

Just can't help but feel like going for what little I actually enjoy doing only allowed me to set myself up as a failure. I wish being in the arts in America was a respected career choice instead of being seen as majoring in unemployment (Yes someone has told me this) A career in the arts is very difficult but not impossible, and it takes a lot of time to get anywhere in such fields, but my family doesn't see that and I'm treated like a kicked puppy.

I don't feel like my medication works. What does healthy feel like?,"I'm on, what I understand is mild, 15 mg of escitalopram. I usually acknowledge the need for medication after a particularly hard low point. I take them everyday until I feel like I'm in a good place. I even start wondering if it even does anything and if I even need it. So I stop.

A considerable amount of time later, I start circling the drain, going from lethargic to suicidal. 

Honestly, sometimes I even start wondering if I'm depressed or just sad. It does hit hard, but it doesn't stay as long as majorly depressed. Two weeks is long for me. I think that's why I keep telling myself I can handle it without the meds. 

Part of it is the disdain I feel for people who say they're depressed so easily just because something marginally upsetting happened to them. I start thinking 'Do I really have it that bad?

Is there anything that could help with the numbness part of depression ?,"Depression manifests as a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of energy, anxiety ,negative thinking, emotional numbness, loss of motivation...etc

So far I found many ways to manage the symptoms of depression but I didn't find anything that helped with the numbness part where you just don't feel anything or care about anything at all nothing makes you happy, sad, cry, your mood is just flat all the time

How can I deal with Bipolar people?,"I’m kind of sick of walking on eggshells around my dad...
He’s sick and needs to be under watch, and my mom doesn’t have that time while I do, so I chose to stay with him and help around. But its incredibly hard to deal with his mercurial temper - it can change at the drop of a hat! Sometimes all it takes to trigger his rage is a little comment.

I’m tired, my heart is tired. I can’t give up on him because I know its a disease and not really his fault, but I’m made of flesh and blood too!

Does anyone has a way to deal with these kind of situation? Just sitting and enduring verbal abuse is so, so draining... my usual coping method is to wait until his temper cools down and for him to apologize - but everytime this happens I break a little.

Someone to talk to,"My life's going downhill rn and I do not have a single person to talk to, I can't cry or anything, pretty numb all of it. I just feel like I could burst any moment, I know it's my fault that I don't have anyone to talk to but it hurts a lot knowing that I'm pretty much alone at this point, I might not even make it.

31M I'm really depressed and feel like life isn't worth it anymore.,"31M I'm really depressed and feel like life isn't worth it anymore. 
My family say I don't deserve to die. It's infuriating, I DO deserve it. I deserve to not suffer anymore. 

I just feel so fearful all the time. 
My marriage is rocky and we have a 3 y/o daughter. Ive gained weight, have a beer belly. I feel so repulsive. 

My career sucks and I don't seem to be going anywhere in life. 

Why not just end my life entirely? I could do it quietly and without issue. I don't see the point of suffering for a couple more decades when it could be over in an afternoon. I'm tired of living for duty alone. 

What's the point of living this way?
Whats the point of screaming this complaint into the void?
I've tried with life, but I haven't succeeded. 

I'm glad other people enjoy being alive, they can keep what I'd like to throw away.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

I have absolutely no motivation and no will to live.....,"I‘m 20, recently I‘ve noticed that I want to do nothing, except, maybe, die... the thing is, I have also dermatillomatia since I was 14, I tried taking some antidepressants, which my psychiatrist has prescribed me, but, unfortunately, they didn’t suit me. So, my life is getting more shitty each day. Yesterday I turned 20. I was with my parents, because I have only one friend, who is my roommate (and now I have no will to expand the circle of friends)...I was crying all the time and my parents were crying too...such a horrible birthday...I didn’t mean to hurt my parents. So, now my mom is planing to be by my side (I‘ve moved to another city, which is 1500km away from my hometown, to start university) till I pass my exams, and then I’ll be examined to find out which pills for sure will help me.

Tired of Choosing between Bills and Food,"Hey everyone, I posted this in r/financialhelp As well but this is also really taking a hit to my sanity.. I’m really having a difficult time getting my finances in order. Back in January my fiancée (21F) and I (21M) moved into our first apartment. Ever since then we have been struggling to get money to save and even pay our bills. We both work full time and both make over minimum wage where we live. Honestly I don’t really know how else to say this so I’m just going to say it how it is. She comes from a wealthier family and sometimes has trouble with spending habits. This is something that we have both discussed and it’s something that she agrees is an issue. Right now we are both in debt (she used my credit card without my knowledge for a while and also promised she would pay me back whenever she did ask me to use it, which didn’t happen, and now I feel really cornered with my finances. I’ve been trying to pay the debt off for months but we struggle to even get enough for our monthly bills. Aside from that we don’t even have much food either and I don’t eat much as a result. I’m just really struggling with this right now because I want us to be able to start saving money and be able to afford things and starts saving and investing but with the debt and the money issues we are facing it just feels kind of impossible right now. Any advice is welcome.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The apartment we live in is well within our budget, we didn’t choose to live somewhere really fancy.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dae have a therapist that does this?,"She's registered and a doctor so I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, but honestly she's not been helpful at all. I want an outside perspective so that I can know if its on me or her.

She talks just like a distracted friend instead of a therapist. 1-3 word responses. For example, I told her I was frustrated and felt lost about something, and she just said 'understand'. Her 'solutions' are things I could come up with on my own and basically boil down to her just saying no every time I bring up a harmful coping mechanism. I already know what's wrong with me and my life but not how to fix it! And she believes that I should talk the most in therapy but I don't feel heard when all she does is....listen?

On June 7 I will suicide,"I'm a 19 year old failure
My final highschool result will be announced on June 10 
I know that I will fail 
In my country malaysia, to be qualified to go to college you need to have atleast a C grade on Bahasa Melayu and Sejarah exam . Both of this exam is in Malay language.
I have problem learning languages,I don't know whether I have any mental disability like dyslexia because I have been practicing and studying and speaking the language but it just doesn't go into my head, will forget everything the next day.
I have been depressed for 6 years I have already attempt suicide multiple time but all failed.
Worst one was abusing on paracetamol and painkiller, I felt Ill and nauseous for 2-3 week. After that not much has changed except that I can't seem to remember thing as good as previously before I overdosed on the medicine. I didn't checkup with doctor, 4months has already passed since my last suicide attempt but now the government has just announced that the Final exam result will be on June 10. I don't want to see my result. I Have failed once in elementary schools it was a horrible experience, everyone look down on me. I tried my hardest to learn the language but I can't. Now my final highschool exam result will be here soon I don't want to go through that again. The people around me is putting too much pressure on me I got a feeling this might be it for me. I have two bottle of cough syrup I'm planning to drink it all. I don't have any problem on English language exam like science in English etc, Is just that because I know that I'm already going to fail I didn't put much effort into studying anymore because if I fail in any one of the two subject Bahasa Melayu or Sejarah the other subject doesn't even matter anymore. 

I don't think I'm going to survive this, but I'm planning to delete this post on June 7 just before I attempt it

I'm not good with school academic but I'm good with day trading, I can have 30-50% gain on my account everyday but because of this depression I have stop, I keep making bad decision and revenge trading and lost 500$

My parents want me to go college but I don't want to. Knowing that I will failed,everyone around me telling me that if I fail my final exam I'm going to fail in life. I don't know whether that's true or not. I'm still young and have not experience the world yet but I don't think I can go through failing in school another time. 

So please anyone, do you have any advice before I make up my mind.
I don't want to die but I don't have the strength to go on 
Everyone around me is making me feel more of an idiot than I already am

I can't work because my father is strict and want me to go college not only that but right now is covid. He doesn't have much money left. If he sees that I failed another time he is going to scold me and I don't know what will happen next, maybe he will kick me.
I really don't know what to do with my life anymore.
I'm someone who likes learning new stuff everyday
I come across day trading and it open my eyes I just need more time to be good and consistent at it but i didn't think that the result will be announced so soon.

I was quite happy and relieved because I was finally recovering and can live normally without side effects of the pill.

What does it take to get better?,"I guess this is just me bitching about life. I understand you have to put in the work for it to get better. But nobody says what that work entails. Sometimes I wish I had a step by step process of what to do to stop feeling this way. “This way” feeling like I’m not good enough. 

Logically I know I have a lot going for me and for the first time in my life I feel somewhat content and excited for the future. But my self worth still depends on LOVE. I hate that. 

I really want to feel happiness inside myself. And I do have things i love about myself. I’m a good writer, ambitious, resourceful, conventionally attractive I guess but I enjoy my soul more than my looks. 

Still, I can’t help but think I am worthless and pathetic and that if I don’t marry before the age of 25 no man will want me. I also spent a lot of time in theredpill which maybe contributes to this way of thinking. I have traditional  values and hate that this generation is so into the hookup culture that perpetuates feeling used up as a way of empowerment. 

If it makes you happy then more power to you I wish I could have meaningless sex and feel some form of enjoyment.

Needing Time to Heal But BF doesn’t get it....am I in the wrong?,"I was involved with a really good, caring man pre-Covid, long distance. I love him and thought it was going to be permanent one day. 
We had a good healthy relationship in the past despite being long distance. During Covid, I didn’t see him for way over a year. We kept in close contact, daily calls and texts, but my depression took a turn. I started taking different meds and was struggling. I tried to tell him this many times via phone and by text and he would give me tough love type responses such as “people have it worse than you” or “it could be worse” or “don’t worry so much”, “look how far you’ve come” or “things will improve soon with Covid.” I felt like he didn’t understand and I basically just stopped trying to explain after trying so often and receiving no sort of acknowledgement or empathy from him. I admit I got fed up trying. 
Then I saw him for the first time in March and it just felt off between us. I was very unwell mentally in my mind, felt like I had a lot going on mentally and I just felt disconnected from him. After the visit, he kept on saying I “seemed different” and he asked what “was going on” with me. I ended up telling him (again) I was struggling with depression, opened up extensively about the details and explained how awful it’s gotten. I also sent him literature on major depression to try and give him objective info I thought maybe he could learn from.
His response was to say I “didn’t communicate” it to him, and then to say he “didn’t get it” over and over. This was irritating but I patiently tried to be fair and hear him out. Then he continued to harp on how he “couldn’t fix” me and he felt bad that he “had no way to fix” me.  I told him I don’t want/need him to fix me, that I have mental illness and he needed to just let me figure it out with my professional medical help, respect that and be patient. So after that, and our weird visit, it felt like he was just making me feel pressure and stress. I felt like I couldn’t handle his needs, his constant need to tell me over and over how he didn’t understand and how he felt bad for not fixing me.
I then decided that I needed to take time apart from him to figure out how to get back on track for me, to try and get better and heal. I realized that trying to be “in” a relationship with him at the moment~ someone who just isn’t in my everyday life to understand firsthand my situation and then doesn’t hear/appreciate what I’m saying, then freaks out that he “can’t fix” me, etc, just is not conducive to me getting better.
I told him all of this, told him I love him but I need to focus my attention right now on me and my health, this is what I need to do to heal. I also told him I can’t give our relationship the attention it needs right now. We took a few weeks not communicating as much. When Id check in and say hi, he didn’t ask me how I was feeling/treatment/anything about my life at all. He literally responded to a simple “Hi, how’s your day going” by responding with a giant text about how he was “not managing it so well”, how he “was struggling” etc, etc.
I ultimately now feel angry bc of his behavior. He then asked to have a phone call to discuss his feelings/how bad he feels without me in his life and I told him I can’t do that bc there’s nothing more I can do, he has to accept the facts as they are, there is no point to getting into another emotional discussion where all he says is how bad he feels.
I don’t think he’s a jerk- I think he’s just ignorant and literally lacks the ability to understand. But at this point I feel like this is a problem I cannot get past if I’m to have any future with him. I’ve become so angry too lately bc I feel like even though he’s unable to deal with this, instead of trying to educate himself, learn more and understand, he’s just being selfish. 
Does anybody think I’m being insensitive, or unfair? I want to make sure I’m being fair.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
My girlfriend is depressed an I can't help her,"I'm not sure if I should post here, maybe there is a subreddit for people like me... I can't find a way to help my girlfriend, she shows all the signs, self loathing above all. She sees me as perfect and capable of anything (obviously far from true) and she seems frustrated with the gap between my ""perfection"" and her perceived inability to live...
In these past months I'm trying to help her become more confident in driving, but as soon as we get in a busy road or in the downtown traffic she panics, I take the wheel and I know we will spend the evening with her telling me to find another girlfriend because she is useless... I don't care if she drives or not but I insist for her to try and push herself to get her a ""victory"" but so far it just caused panic and problems, should I stop pushing her? I want to give her a sense of progress but I really don't know how, she sees a psychologist but it doesn't seem to help...

Death anxiety got me feeling like life is pointless and exhausting and it's all a nightmare.,"Hello! So i'v been depressed and anxious for a long time i think but recently i started having thoughts about death every single day and it's like i opened pandoras box. 

Death is so final, so scary. It makes life seem pointless, why build something up when it's just a matter of time before it all ends and how am i supposed to enjoy this experience with a metaphorical gun to my head that i don't know when it will go off? 

I tried looking at spirituality and stuff because nobody knows what happens when you die right? But it seems logical that we just die and the other stuff is wishful thinking... and even if there were an afterlife that would kinda subtract from the meaning of living this one. 

This is one big bad boogieman that no adult can come and safe me from and it's horrible....

So today and yesterday i started having more thoughts about dying, yesterday i went snorkeling and had to quit because i kept thinking about drowning and how that would suck. Today i thought that i might as well die now since nothing matters and it's an inevitability and i'm tired of fighting. 

But they are thoughts and i feel some distance between me and the action. I still rationally think that i might as well try everything, try to get better.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,"Basically, I feel like I'm doing ""all the things"" that someone with depression is supposed to do. 

I exercise, eat relatively healthily, maintain several close relationships with friends and family, take medication and vitamins, go to therapy, try to keep busy but not burn out... 

And I'm still stuck. There's no situational issues or any residual trauma that makes me feel this way. I've just always been depressed, which runs in my family. 

It makes me think of the quote, ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result."" I feel like I'm just working WAY too hard to stay afloat, doing the same things every day and expecting that eventually I'll feel better. 

I don't want to give up. I'm NOT going to give up. I just feel crazy, I feel like all of my energy is going towards keeping myself alive, and I don't have any room to just BREATHE. 

I've had to leave work early or call in sick a few times in the last few weeks because I couldn't stop crying about nothing. I'm so stressed by just doing my basic daily routine that I have kind of a meltdown every night when I get home from work. My days off are equally difficult.

I try to do the things that I know bring me joy, even when I don't feel it. I'm just starting to feel a little bit insane expecting things to get better without some sort of change, and I feel that I'm running out of options for things to change or improve.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t want to go swimming at the lake tonight.....,"But it seems like I’ve been crying out for help from every point I’ve tried to make, and no one is interested in helping me the way I’ve asked.

&gt;&gt;Forget education/employment pipelines

&gt;&gt;Forget Criminalizing American Political Discrimination.  



I just wanted to become a fucking professional opera singer, and I wanted help from others making that a reality, after 20 years of working towards it alone weren’t doing anything to make it a reality.  And it seems like nobody cares if it kills me that no matter how hard I’ve tried to achieve that goal, I’ve always come up short on my own, while everybody else makes themselves a part of these segregating communities against me.

So tonight I’m contemplating wether I ought to swim out into the middle of the lake and end it all.   Nobody wants to help me when I’ve asked for help.  Nobody wants to implement alternative solutions when I’ve tried to present them to people.  Nobody wants to even touch me, let alone care if I’m on the cusp of deciding to end my life.   

I don’t want to go swimming at the lake tonight.  But it seems like nobody wants to stop me because they care.  They only want to stop me to save face, and I can’t pull myself back when they want to stop me for reasons as selfish as why I want to end my life tonight.

I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember and it's only getting harder to reason against harming myself.,"I never had a catalyst or anything for my depression or suicidal ideations. It's just been present for a very long time. I've gone through prescribed regimens of medication, seen counselors, stayed active and healthy, made friends very easily, and just overall tried to keep myself out there and try or experience new things to see if I could find that calling in life for myself over my life. Things have generally gone very well for me in life other than the numerous times I let my suicidal thoughts get the best of me and I either let shit fall apart or an attempt on my own life puts me down a notch. This has been something that's just always been present and feels very dominating as a part of who I am. It used to scare me and I used to want to feel better than this, but I just feel completely indifferent and empty to it and everything else in life now. I don't have the energy to pretend I'm a normal person or talk to people, I don't experience any emotions, all of my old hobbies and such feel like a chore, and I can't envision wanting anything in the future. This ""depersonalization"" side of my suicidal ideations has been going on for a couple years now and more than ever I just can't find any reason or desire to stay alive. I've been miserable for as long as I can remember and I know it's not right, but, at this point I don't know any other mindset other then feeling this way. I know how to be a decent human being, I do good at work and such, I've developed very close relationships in platonic and romantic senses before, but nothing makes it feel worth the effort at all.

r/depression is telling unwell people incredibly evil things.,"I know this is not the same group, but I'm absolutely shocked at and have noone to talk about regarding this.

They tell a mentally unwell person with relationship problems that:

(a) the solution is to perpetually hate, and

(b) They should never have children as that will merely perpetuate their misery.

This is the sort of material an absolute psychopath would tell a mentally ill person, yet when I question it I get kicked.

"Struggling to cope in the day to day, having dark thoughts","TW: Mentions of Self-h*rm and thoughts of s*icide.

Hi guys, I really don't feel up to formatting or putting it neatly, but I've been struggling a lot. In my recent quest for a therapist (via insurance -- it's a hassle) more and more issues keep popping up that has worsened my mental and emotional health. I've been having darker thoughts, thoughts of hurting myself really badly, of c*tting and oftentimes when I'm riding my bike, how it'd feel to ride into traffic and get hit. S*icidal thoughts near-plague me weekly, and while I'm trying so desperately to be better, there's something around the corner that brings my decent to good mood down to sad or angry or confused, and it's all been so much.

I've been crying more, all the thoughts in my head overwhelm me, I question myself in my relationship, I question my partner, I question the future of not only my partner and I, but our families, our friends, our pets and jobs. It's a scary time right now, I'm so burnt out from life and want to just take a nap for three years. These thoughts won't stop, no matter if I face them head on or distract myself; I just want a break.

I try talking to my friends, communicating more, and it helps a little but I fear my issues may become burden for them, when they're struggling with their own things right now. I want to be there for them, too! But it's hard! I have no energy! Everything feels scary and tiresome and I feel so dreadfully lonely in my interpersonal relationships.

Contacting more therapists and hoping for the best, may consider asking for one that prescribes medication, but preferably not.

I am depressed.. nofap 200+ day plus,"Hello

I have been on an incredible streak with nofap, which i thought would help with my depression. I lost my counter but it should be over 200 days now. I used to suffer everyday by watching porn and edging/climaxing with a pillow or hand in order to fall asleep. It was a huge struggle for many years, but now, I find it easy not to do both those things. Potentially having someone to sleep with has helped me not relapse, however, I have not felt any benefits of Nofap and it's frustrating.

I was depressed before, I'm depressed now. I had no motivation before, I have none now. The only reason I keep going is because of my will power.. and I feel at my breaking point. I am educated, with a stable job now and a wonderful girlfriend and friends who all love me. I count those blessings daily, but its so difficult because I am very negative. No positive thoughts run through my mind, just negative ones and negative memories. My SO and I have sex almost daily, but it''s hard for me to get hard. She excites me greatly, but its difficult for me to have sensation there or to will myself to get hard because I have thoughts like I am too small or I remind myself she has had sex before me and I'm just so in my head, she wants me to be dominant but I really act submissive.

I work out, I am extremely fit. I am very physically attractive according to many people, I have a lot of charm as people love to point out to me. Why don't i see any of it? why do i not like myself? i don't have a semblance of a identity and my brain is so foggy. I discussed with my therapist, and Meds are on the table but i don't think that will help me be more confident with myself... i cant meditate for long because my thoughts are just so painful. I am very introverted.any one can help me with any of this? or just to cheer me up? I am an introvert who wants to learn to be more social and just to relax and have control of my thoughts. I can give advice on Nofap and how to succeed on your goals, I can motivate other people easily enough its just my relationship with myself isn't the best.

TLDR- sorry for my rambling, i don't feel the benefits of Nofap 200+ days... i am still depressed and awkward.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Chronic Depression and Work Performance,"Hello. 

I need someone's thoughts or advice. I have several diagnosed illnesses, persistent grieving disorder and pdd (with frequent mdes, so thanks brain for the double depression 😅). I am unmedicaded

In that past couple months after a huge mde I never quite made it completely out and have been progressively doing worse to a point where my work performance is suffering, I've received a couple of warnings to ""get my sh t together"" (not in those exact words but close). I've never been in such a position where my work ability has lacked because of this. Like I genuinely feel like I'm going to either get fired sooner or later or suddenly quit, because of my mental state. 

I am going to discuss with my psychiatrist medication. We had talked about it before but they basically said we could talk more in detail when I was ready. 

But a part of me has been considering temporary disability to basically be able to figure myself out, figure out the right meds if necessary, right dosage, etc before putting myself out there to work. I feel so heavy everytime I get ready for the day like ""what am I going to mess up today"" and its making everything so much worse. My work frustration is literally dragging me down harder. I'm so frustrated with myself and I'm so tired of feeling like this all the time.

I then met someone, he was ok in the beginning but then he started purposely saying things to hurt me; like saying I’d be the worst person in the world to have a kid with, how he’d never marry me, and also call me a fat c**t (I’m not actually fat) he apologised for all of that saying he only said it because he wanted to hurt me. but recently, he’s started lying to me and then we’d get in to a fight and he’d say I’m mentally sick and that I’m really messed up and obviously have loads of insecurities. 

For the past 7 years I’ve felt SO low! My mood changes so quickly, i get moody quite often, I am constantly doubting myself and after the recent lies from my ‘current’ partner I’ve come to realise I can’t trust him or believe a word he says anymore. I’ve also been having bad thoughts- not so much suicidal, more that I think it would be so much easier for people if I just died- In my head I’ve put in place what would happen to my child if I did die. 

Am I depressed or just messed up from my past? 

I’m so stubborn I don’t want to talk to a doctor in fear they would laugh in my face and say I’m just a waste of time. I don’t want to speak to family in fear that they would pity me. I don’t want to speak to friends because I’d feel embarrassed. I can’t talk to work because it’s such a stressful job they’d only worry that I may end up taking time off work!

I don’t know what to do anymore.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Everything I used to enjoy feels like work now. What can I do?,I just feel so anxious and filled with existensial dread. I want to enjoy the things I used to enjoy before like video games but literally anything that takes some kind of effort feels like a lot of work. So instead I just lay in bed on my phone and waste my life away I feel so horrible. Before I coud get into video games and enjoy the challenge but now I just feel extremely frustrated and just want to try to finish it as soon as possible which takes the fun away.

I just don't care badly enough unless I'm in a crisis. Nothing is really interesting or exciting. How do I care enough ?,"I can't get myself to work on my resume. I can't get myself to apply to jobs. I can't get myself to look for a new doctor. I can't get myself to read a book. I'm not even interested in planning a trip. It's all just whatever to me.

I only do things if I HAVE to or if I'm inspired by a strong emotion. Like if I'm angry, I'll do something. But that won't last long. 

I used to be ambitious. I used to care a lot more. I used to have some sense of passion. Now - I see just how powerless I've always been and how overall meaningless it is to care so god damn much. 

I understand I need to be providing others with something of value to get value in return. I understand that the more value I can give, the more value I get. It's just that whatever value I can get in return just doesn't really appeal to me. None of it is incredibly interesting or exciting. And even what I would classify as the most exciting - it's not like I can accomplish it. I can't attract the type of life companion that I want because I wouldn't even date myself. I don't have the type of money as Bezos does to see Earth from space and it's extremely unlikely I ever will be able to attain it, let alone attaining it ethically without harming others and by paying my fair share of taxes.

Life's weird.,"Life is a weird place. With all the bad stuff in it and with life making no sense. I'm depressed. I feel like a bag in the wind and that's pretty much the jist of it. It's hard to be happy when you don't see it making sense to be happy. People don't understand a lot of the time and tell me to just live your best life and be positive or whatever. I still feel this way, and it confuses me as much as everyone else. I'm not sure if I want to feel the way I do. It'd be nice if I completely forget and never see being depressed as a thing that exists. It's a thing though and I can't seem to shake off that this is how I feel. I'm not motivated to do much or if I do have the motivation I'm unsure of what to do. So the motivation lingers until it's finally gone from my thoughts. I'm not sure what I'll do with my life, I'm barely living it. I'm not a person that I would like to be and I'm not focused on life. I've been trying to make sense of how I feel. My friends don't speak to me, they straight out don't call or text and haven't for months. They've never really called or texted much, so I question myself and our friendship. I have bad self esteem which makes things wonky. My life has been moderately fine, the colors are just drained. I'm also failing and got no motivation for school as well! I know what I should be doing but I don't seem to care cause I'm depressed. Yeah, so I got no idea what to do with life. Any advice that'd help me out?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

So it’s all my fault that I’m like this. I’m not trying to get better mentally hence I must not be wanting to. I stopped going to the therapist after my mother asked me to, because I didn’t want to? I have thoughts of ending it all and be done with it every now and then, but I haven’t done it, so I don’t want to? I don’t know, maybe I am just pretending.

"Trying to figure out ""why""?","I'm 23, male, born and raised in a middle class family in a first world country. No serious traumas I'm aware of, only thing I can think of is not having an emotionally available father. That's about all I have to complain about.

Family history - both my parents and lots of cousins are on depression medication. I was on it for around a year until I tapered off. 

I grew up with no reason to be depressed but from around age 12-13 to now (10 years) I have been getting more depressed, anxiety and anhedonia.

What went wrong in my brain during my developmental years? Is this purely hereditary? Was I destined to be depressed due to some predisposition from my parents genetics?

Its so frustrating I want to give up. I've tried medication, therapy, meditation, excercise, CBT.

What helps you with your insomnia?,"I remember how relaxing and fulfilling it was to sleep when I was a kid. I couldn’t get enough of it! I slept with my blankie, I sucked my thumb, I snuggled, I was never cold when the window was open, and I hated having to wake up for school in the morning.

At 14 I first got depressed and started experiencing uncomfortability during sleep- I was always very cold. Then, at 18, I got into a depressive episode and with the pressure to study well at uni my social anxiety increased. I couldn’t go out during the day because I felt like all the people around were judging me for not working hard enough, not looking well enough, and other things. So I started sleeping through the day and living at night. 

Now that I’ve worked through social anxiety it is not quite so bad and I enjoy getting up early in the morning because it feels like the proper and healthy way to go about my day. 

However, no matter how much or how little I do during the day, I can’t fall asleep at night. I’m just not tired. It’s kinda like leaving the car running- I’m not doing anything, but the thoughts are racing inside my head. 

I’ve tried the 4-7-8 breathing technique, progressive muscle relaxation, but nothing seems to work. I also try to eat early and let fresh air into the room. 

What helps you to calm down before going to sleep?

working with bpd &amp; anxiety,"hi all,

i'm only 24 this year but i feel like i've hit rockbottom. i graduated 3 years ago with a degree, got a fulltime job soon after and worked for 2 years. i liked my job, but i hated my boss and left without securing a job back in february 2021. i decided to get help for my depression which i only got the courage to just a month ago, although i've been suffering for years. it was then that i got diagnosed with bpd. i just started a new job with a good pay, high stress level, however i feel like its making my depression worse. everyday i wake up with a heavy heart, breakdown and cry few times a day. i feel like i have no more will to live, but idk if its because of the job or its just me...i am torn between wanting to quit my job, or just continue living like this. i feel like if i quit this job, it would be hard to get an opportunity like this again, especially with a good pay. also, if i do quit and take a break, it would leave a big gap in my resume between february to now...which i dont think recruiters will think good of me :( i am not sure what i should do...my friends told me to stay in my job but they dont understand how i feel...","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
Should I get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward so they can force me to start my antidepressant?,"I’m having a hard time. My anxiety skyrocketed. I’m going through an IBS flare up. I haven’t had a colonoscopy or gastroscopy yet, but I’ve had blood tests, stool tests, ultrasonography and MRI done. All perfectly normal. So there is still a possibility that it’s something else but it’s not very likely.

Every time I have to poo I get an anxiety attack. I think it’s a mild one because I don’t lose control or pass out, but I get this surge of absolute despair, racing thoughts, I start the breathe shallowly, I start to shake, cold sweats, weird muscle spasms in my body etc. I mean it might be mild but it doesn’t feel mild really.

Since I poo everyday I get these attacks everyday, sometimes multiple times, sometimes not even triggered by having to poo. A slightly weird feeling in my stomach can cause me to spiral into an anxiety attack.

I’ve been prescribed Effexor along with Remeron, I’ve already been on Remeron but as you can guess I don’t think it has any effect on me anymore. It used to work though, it didn’t help me too much but I was feeling better. This was a year ago of course. Since then it lost its effectiveness.

My psych warned me that I shouldn’t look up Effexor online. Unfortunately she was too late; since I research antidepressants a lot I already knew its side effects, how does it feel while starting, how shitty the withdrawals are etc.

I said ok, because I was desperate. But there is a problem. It’s been a while, and I can’t bring myself to take my medication. And I know that I have to take it, because there isn’t much else left to try. This is not just my opinion, my psych said it herself.

So I have to get better. I have to take my medicine to get better, but I’m scared of it. The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets. The worse my anxiety gets the more I get scared, and it gets even harder to start my medicine. Lately I haven’t been able to think about anything else other than my bowel issues, I can’t even watch a youtube video.

I’m not suicidal; I have suicidal thoughts yes but I haven’t made any plans, and I have things I want to do, you know? I dropped out of college, and I want to go back. I’m not even exaggerating when I say this; I see myself going back to school literally every night in my dreams. I have gender dysphoria, and I want to at least know how it feels like to be comfortable in your own body. And these things keep me going.

But I also know that I have to take my medicine, and I just don’t know how I can do that. I thought of a couple things that I can try.

-First, I can get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward. Make them force me to take my medicine. There are several upsides and downsides with that. If I get an anxiety attack they can intervene. I will be forced to take the medicine, so it has a higher probability of success. But on the other hand, the psychiatric wards in my country have some problems. I’ve read a lot about human rights violations, abuse, mistreatment, violence etc. And I’m sure you can understand, I don’t need this stuff on top of my problems. Also since I’m not a danger to myself or to others they might not even accept me. Also my parents will probably be very angry with me, because I don’t look very nervous or stressed from outside.

-Second, find a way to start taking them on my own. I can ask to start from a lower dose. My psych wanted me to start at 150mg. Effexor XR is available with dosages as low as 37.5mg. I can ask for anti anxiety medication. I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting. This option has upsides and downsides too. First of all if I ask them for anti anxiety medication I’m guaranteed to be seen as a drug seeking patient. They did that before and I don’t even have any drug abuse history. Even if I get them I might not have the willpower to start them. I might end up getting an anxiety attack even if I take anti anxiety medication.

Okay here is the part where I’m talking about stuff I don’t really know much about.

The anti nausea medication I have is Zofran. From what I understand the reason antidepressants cause nausea is because they increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and the digestive system. As a result of that the increased levels of serotonin agonizes the 5HT3 receptors and this causes nausea/vomiting. With repeated use the 5HT3 receptors become down-regulated/desensitized and because of that nausea/vomiting stops.

Now if I were to take Zofran it will prevent me from getting nauseous because it will prevent serotonin from agonizing the 5HT3 receptors, since it’s a 5HT3 antagonist. But that means it will also prevent 5HT3 receptors from downregulated/desensitized, because they aren’t being excessively agonized, and when I stop taking Zofran I will become nauseous or I will vomit, and that defeats the whole purpose of taking Zofran. I don’t want to take Zofran continuously because it comes with its own side effects.

End of the part where I’m talking about stuff that I shouldn’t be talking about.

So now the upsides of the second option.
I won’t have to deal with the psych ward. Considering the healthcare system in my country, I have good reasons to believe that the care they provide at the ward is not good enough. I won’t have to do a lot of explaining to my parents. I won’t have to risk abuse and stuff like that. The “revolving door syndrome” appears to be very prevalent with the mental health facilities in my country.

So what should I do? I know the answer is “if you have a psych why not ask them?” and I know that getting advice from a bunch of strangers on reddit is not a very wise decision, but I really need the opinions of some strangers on reddit on this.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

My depressed partner drains me,"tl;dr: My partner has been depressed and not knowing what to do with his life for a long time. I am the only person he relys on for support and I can't bear it any longer. It starts to severely affect my own life quality and happiness.

I (30/f) met my partner (32/m) at university eight years ago. He was a very fun, open and active guy with a huge social group. After two years of being friends we started dating. It was around that time that he was done with all his courses and papers and the only thing left for him to finish uni was to write his bachelor's thesis. That didn't happen for another four years.   
Within that time he basically didn't do anything. Didn't write his thesis, didn't get a job. He told me, that he had no clue, what he wants to do with his life and I tried to encourage him to just do some internships to figure that out, but he never did. He is fortunate enough that his parents pay for his expenses (always did and still do), so money wouldn't be the problem. He never did any internship. 

Fast forward six years and the situation is still the same. He did eventually finish his bachelor's and started a master's degree but realized that studying just isn't for him. However he still isn't properly searching for jobs or internships or general input that would help him figure out, what he wants to do or be. The thing is, that his self esteem is lower than the mariana trench. He feels like he doens't know anything and is underqualified for basically every job. He's not. He's incredibly smart, attentive and detail orientated and has a great passion for social justice but he keeps telling himself that he isn't enough for any job and he doens't dare to apply. I don't know how to help him. All my affirmations seem to not penetrate his mindfog. However, the problem is that I'm the only one he's talking to. Because he realized that all his peers moved on he stopped having contact with them because he was embarassed. 

So here is the thing. I know he's depressed and I know that he is busy with surviving day to day. But I'm pissed. I sometimes get so angry and frustrated with him. He doesn't go to therapy and I don't know, if he really tried to get a therapist but the waiting lists are too long or if he didn't try hard enough. He won't tell me. Same thing with his job situation. I don't know, if he is searching and for what. Everytime I ask him, what he wants to be or do he tells me, he doesn't know. And I started asking him really deconstructed questions like ""what kind of activities (writing texts/organizing events/making statistic sheets/etc) do you like?"" ""do you want to work alone or in a team?"" ""what goals (helping people and what kind of people/income/etc) do you want to be met?"" and so on. It's always ""I don't know.""

I am getting really impatient. It's been six years and he has so much potential that he doesn't see or use. Everytime I suggest something, he doesn't use that info, but feels stupid, becaus he didn't have the idea himself. Doesn't matter that I keep reassuring him that it is okay, to need help or not know everything on the spot. He feels stupid and blocks any further conversation and than i find myself trying to calm him down and in the end he promises me to change things, but never does. Probably because he really doesn't have the energy, I get that on an intellectual level. I understand it. I still feel extremely frustrated.

This whole situation keeps our life on hold. It didn't matter to me for a long time. I always told myself, that he will find his way and that he will figure everything out, but now we are in our thirties and I really want to start a family. I want to get married and have children and start the next chapter. I can't do that with a man who barely survives. And it starts to severely affect me. I get so impatient with him and sometimes I find myself blaming him and I know, that is a terrible thing to do to a depressed person and that i should be patient and understanding. But I'm carrying this alone, because he doesn't talk to anyone else about his struggles. 

The worst part is, that he has been away for two weeks to look after his parents' house while they were on vacation and I have felt so good! So so good! So free. I started singing again while doing chores and had a dance party with myself and there were a lot of those little signs of being happy again. He's back home now and I feel like I'm suffocating. I didn't realize it at first, because we're always together. But I feel like I can't be happy, because he isn't. I feel like I can't rejoice over my little victories because he has none. I want to talk about my masters and my ideas for work and all the new input I'm getting (I am studying for a master's degree btw), but I feel guilty, because he isn't passionate about anything. I feel like i can't live my life because I know, that everything I do reminds him of all the things, he doesn't (earning money, socialize, building a future, personal growth).

I really do love him and I don't want to break up or anything. But I also don't know, how I should move on and how we can survive as a couple any longer. I need to breathe but I can't.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I keep calling out of work,"I have severe depression. Some days are good, but some days are just terrible. I will wake up in the morning and I can’t get out of bed. The depression is crippling and hurts. I can’t motivate myself to go to work some mornings because the depression just hits me like a ton of bricks. And so…I call out of work. I make up some excuse that I’m “sick” but like with a stomach bug-not admitting that I’ve lost all motivation. I need help. The depression takes such a strong hold on me some mornings. I need advice on how to push through the negativity and just go to work. It’s so hard for me. I want to work. I want to pay my bills and live a “normal life”.

She finally had enough and yelled at me. I don’t blame her, really. But it just made me hate myself more. I hate that I’m like this.

"""I hate myself"" ... Change from CBT to psychoanalytic?","Hi, maybe someone got some insight into this.

I have been in cognitive behavioral therapy for years. While it helped me coping with rumination and anxiety, I still don't like myself very much. I am often under the impression I should be someone else, someone better... be more manly, be more independent, be more active... well, it goes on for a while :/

Now, recently a friend got me to think about my childhood, and one thing stood out. In 3rd or 4th grade I wrote the sentence ""I hate myself"" over and over again in some of my school notebooks. None of the teachers seemed to notice it - at least I don't remember ever being asked about it. Also I seem to have a lot less memories about my childhood than other people.

My mum told me three years ago, after I just came out of a two-month stationary therapy and  mentioned to her that I have some gaps in my memory, that I ""had a happy childhood"".

I have no reason to doubt her honesty, but I know she is able to see things the way she wants them to.

Also, I want to cry all the time, but I can't. It often is on the edge, but mostly it stays there, or just a few seconds of real crying and then I get too self-conscious, I guess, and it stops. It's killing me... like something wanting to get out... I'm 31 and just want to cry a whole day like a baby, but I can't.

Is it maybe time to go an ""old-school"" psychoanalytic approach? I just have vague notions of couches and old bearded men and hypnosis:) My therapist is great, but there is no real breakthrough. It always feels like there must be more. I even consider trying psychedelics now to help me get to the root.

Well, that was a lot. Any help, insight, comment is appreciated.

Losing myself in tv and phone games,"Logically I know I need to put my energy towards productive or positive things more and not wreck my brain with hours of passive tv and phone games. Because living here at my parents is dangerous for me. I've become too comfortable I guess because I don't want to feel anxiety again, and I stay in a really small box. I don't even smile much,make eye contact or spend time with family because my nervous system and brain can't handle the unpredictability of interactions with them, needing to be on the defense so they can't affirm my negative fears about myself and my future.

I used to be outgoing and extremely energetic and passionate about life. Then trauma hit and I don't have the energy to afford to spend on things that don't earn me health or money. Not proud but it's true and if you can relate then you understand what I mean. If you're financially dependent on other people your very health and future hangs in the balance of other people's whims and no good things can be trusted until there is income, because every good interaction eventually has a circumstance where someone makes an offer and I can't say no because I'm under their thumb. 

I need a job that requires very little emotional energy/faking happiness, and requires more problem solving or physical labor. I never got proper schooling or job training, worked mostly on organic farms but now I want to pursue income that is compatible with my post trauma body and brain. 

I'm afraid that my world has become so small and limited compared to what it needed to be, and I need to expand it again. I practice yoga, meditate, cook, walk in nature a lot, dropped all unhealthy habits except the tv and phone. I'm still not happy and feel terrible to not know what direction I should be devoting all my energy to, to break me out of this sad sad hole asap.

TL;DR
what would you do in my limited position to save yourself from negative coping habits of zoning out with tv and phone games? I'm totally fine with moving by the way.

I'm begging someone for support rn. Anyone," I can honestly say I'm at the lowest point in my life rn. I'm a 26M, and I've crashed and burned everything, destroyed every relationship in my life, and live in complete isolation. I've had crippling depression and panic disorder ever since I was a child, and I've never been so alone in my life. A mixture of substance abuse, panic, and depression has made it difficult to continue. I honestly don't expect anyone to truly gaf, but even to just pretend would give me a sense that I'm not alone.

I've lived in poverty my entire life, my family was dirty and parents addicted to drugs, I was continuously sexually abused, and it's created an endless amount of deep rooted issues in my mind. I also have severe bipolar disorder, and because of it I push everyone away with my craziness. My father left me when I was 4, my entire family (except for my mom) admitted they wanted me aborted. This includes my grandparents, aunts, etc. I was homeless with my mother, living in a car for the first 6 years of my life.

I'd had it by the time I was 13. I was never home, would stay at friends houses for weeks at a time, wander the streets, because going home was torture. Constant violence, fighting, yelling and neglect, with police constantly showing up at the house. My family never fed me, and I basically had to beg friends for food. At 13, I started using drugs because I was finally accepted by my friend group. I was constantly high, and everyone in school warned people to stay away from me. I was in and out of juvy, and literally the cops arrested me in the middle of class when I was 17, and I was expelled. My family disowned me, and my aunt was kind enough to let me stay with her until I was 18. It was the greatest act of kindness I've ever known.

At age 16, my met my first gf, and I jumped headfirst. I was wholeheartedly convinced she was the woman I was going to marry. Eventually, after I had gone to jail, she decided to leave me and fucked 3 of my best friends... at the same time. It was complete betrayal, and that's when I realized I was truly alone. No friends, no family, it really fucked me up. That's when my anxiety started to peak. The last few years of high school, I was addicted to cough syrup and would go to school tripping every single day. It destroyed my social skills, and fucked up my mind permanently. Eventually, after turning 21, I turned to alcohol. For the last 4 years, I've drank basically everyday. I'm at the point where I just hole up in my room, drinking around 18 - 20 drinks continuously everyday. Nothing is more terrifying than alcohol withdrawal. I've gone to the hospital on numerous occasions for it, and every morning and night I'm absolutely convinced I'll die of a heart attack. My 2nd gf I met 4 years ago. Finally, she'd had it with my addiction and irrational behavior, and she left me. The thought of her being with another man crushes me, and I'm at my lowest point. I can't stop drinking, haven't showered in weeks. I have alcohol withdrawals constantly, and I can't even rid myself of the pain because when I start to drink again, it's constant vomiting. I have nobody, and she was the only one that I had. I'd call her at the end of everyday, and atleast I had someone to back me up. Ik it's so cliche, but really she was my only hope.

I'm just really at the end, and just need someone to tell me it gets better. My life has been aweful since birth, and I just can't find hope. If you took the time to read this, I really appreciate it.

TW; First Fatherless Father's Day,"I(23m) lost my dad to covid-19 at the start of this year. I woke up and realized what day it is and just started sobbing. My partner(25f) lost her dad at a young age and has numbed herself to cope as his passing played a huge part in the path her life took, but this is still fresh for me. It's the first Father's Day without him. I asked for some support from her and her responses were very cold. ""You can't let today hurt you like this."" ""I just ignore this day, you gotta just stay off your phone."" ""You can't cry all day about this."" 

I get that she's had time to cope with this trauma, and her responses are partly to protect herself from her feelings about her own dad she's been dealing with for years, but fuck. I needed support, just some time to let it out and confront my feelings, and after the way she responded I'm no longer sure how I feel about this woman. What would you do?

I try really hard to be understanding of others feelings, and especially compassionate of my partners feelings. But I honestly don't know if I can be with someone who would invalidate my feelings like that, even with their own trauma. She came to apologize and acknowledge that she was being inconsiderate, but that hurt me so much I don't even want to look at her right now.

I don't know. I love this woman, and I'm incredibly patient with partners. Her responses show a fundamental lack of compassion that I can't teach, but her apology shows an understanding of her fuck up and an attempt to right it, so I don't know what to do about it. Maybe after I take some time to cool off we can talk about it and gain better understanding.

I have been going to my dentist since I was a little girl, she knows my family very well and I am scared to go show her my absolutely horrible teeth (I just KNOW I have a lot of cavities right now because of my depression/neglect has never been as bad as during covid and I just feel the pain). 

My retainers don't fit anymore and I'm terrified of my orthodontist's reaction, but mainly my parents. I feel like a terrible child because they have spent so much money on braces. 

Please, does anyone have a way how to best handle this situation? (Mainly how to tell everyone mentioned in my post, I have an appointment with my dentist in a couple of weeks)

I feel so terribly guilty and it just adds to the problem, but it's a vicious cycle at this point.

I'm tired of existing,"What's the fucking point? I'm not suicidal, but my life feels like it's crashing down around me in the space of less than a day and I wish I could just blink out of existence. Erase me from fucking time so nobody has to mourn me, they'll just never know I fucking existed.

I lost my job today. I really enjoyed it, but apparently I wasn't doing enough to pass probation (which still had 3 weeks to go). I'm nearly 30, and I started this job in January. It was the first time in my life where I felt like I had stable work, Monday to Friday 9-5 mundanity and I loved that. My partner and I had been going through a rocky patch, but with this stability came improvement. I have been in and out of work for the last 3 years, seemingly never truly on my own terms. She supported us throughout my instability even when things got hard. Now I'm afraid this is undoing all that and I'm scared she's gonna fucking leave, because I'm a valueless cunt.

I would say I don't care any more but I do care, a lot. I would give anything not to feel this. I would give anything not to feel rn.

Severe treatment resistant depression Tried therapy meds lifestyle changes exercise basically everything what do I do ? am I doomed in this condition ? Will it ever ends ?,"The title basically summed it up I've been dealing with depression for around a year till now and it just gets worse with time please don't suggest things like ""fight it"" ""don't give up"" there's nothing to fight or to give up on. Depression affects everyone differently and My depression **Isn't the type** where I have negative thinking or suicidal that I can get over with therapy my depression is basically **severe anhedonia and fatigue** Nothing absolutely nothing I can enjoy foods doesn't taste good girls don't make me feel horny orgasms are numb dog doesn't make me feel happy friendship and exercise doesn't help me a bit.   


So there's nothing to fight it's just that the reward centers in my brain for some reason decided to turn off and no matter what I do I can't get them to turn back on again. And please please don't suggest ""working on the root cause"" I'm not depressed because I dropped my ice cream or because the teacher yelled at me I'm depressed because I have fcked up genetics and I'm trying to cure it.  


I fking tried everything I tried therapy I tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I tried every antidepressant SSRI SNRI Tricyclic Wellbutrin Mirtazapine Atypical antipsychotics they helped minor symptoms like concentration-fatigue-insomnia but did absolutely nothing for my anhedonia.

Anhedonia destroyed my relationships costed my friends took my gf away obliterated my college marks and pretty much is fcking up my life

So what do I do ? Keep living in this condition and not giving up ? but for what if nothing I do I enjoy what's the point of living on ? if there's no chance that a brighter tomorrow will come what point is there in going on ?

Pretty sure I’m the least favorite child,"My mom (f, 45) treats me (FtM trans, 20) like shit, yet my younger brother (m, 4) is allowed to hit her, swear at her, scream his demands at her, etc without getting more than a quiet “don’t do that.” He’s become the brattiest and most rude child I’ve ever seen. He used to be a very nice and polite kid, but now he knows he can get away with being a total asshole, so he constantly acts like a total asshole. He says stuff like “give me the TV remote or I’ll kill you and cut your eyes out”, like horror movie scenarios. I get screamed at if I try to discipline him and tell him he doesn’t need to be saying that sort of thing. 

If I was to do the same thing, I would be screamed at, told to get a job (I’m mentally and physically disabled, currently going through occupational therapy to help find me a suitable job, but this isn’t enough to keep her happy), have things taken away, etc. 

Another brother of mine (m, 14) completely agrees that my mom’s parenting is ineffective. My mom is nicer to him than she is to me, but she’s still unnecessarily rude to him as well. We’ve both tried bringing it up to her, but she just gets defensive and resorts to personal attacks against us both. For example, for me she would say something like “well you don’t work and you’re taking all my money” and for my brother she would say stuff like “well you’re just on your computer all day.” She also defends her crappy parenting by saying “you wouldn’t understand, you’re not a parent” I may not be a parent and I don’t plan on ever being one, but at least I know that no one, much less 4 year old children, shouldn’t be punching people to get what they want and using threatening demands. 

I don’t know how much longer I can keep taking all these attacks while my little brother is allowed to be a dick. It’s taken a huge toll on me and I constantly feel like I’m never doing good enough in life. I know I’m the family disappointment by being trans, autistic, and fat, but god fucking dammit I’m trying my best. But my best is never and has never been enough.

How do I help my depressive best friend?,"My (m27) best friend (f24) is a brilliant person with an impressive amount of potential to do anything, to create beauty, be it writing, painting or singing, but she is constantly unmotivated to do anything, she’s failing at her job (a job I helped her get), she’s always oversleeping and sleeping unreasonably late, when she tells me what she feels she says she feels useless, worthless, depressed and incapable to fit the potential I always tell her I see in her. 

She’s often wondering what’s the point of even trying. I’m usually texting her and she seems alright, but when i wish her good night and go to sleep she always remains awake for hours while I sleep, and thats when her panic, depression and anxiety invades her, when she’s alone, but I can’t stay awake with her because I have to work early in the morning.

She usually comes to me looking for supportive words and I know I make her feel better, but that effect wears off and I fear I can’t be there for her 100% of the time. I want her to be happy even when I’m not around, not because I don’t want to help her, but because I won’t be there forever, and her mental peace shouldn’t depend on me.

I'm a recovering alcoholic with Severe Depression,"I started drinking about 8 years ago, and I've been sober for 2 years. Within those 6 years, I went from casually drinking, to drinking a fifth of Vodka a day. It got so bad that if I went without alcohol for a day I would start to have withdrawals. I pawned a lot of my stuff just for alcohol. I destroyed my relationship with my son and his mom. I did a lot of things in that time that I wouldn't ever do today. I look back on it and wonder why I even acted the way I did. I was a complete asshole. Fast forward to today, and I'm still dealing with a lot of issues. I can't function like a normal human being. I've withdrawn myself from almost everyone. I have no desire to go out and make friends or have fun. (Not that I care to have a social life I just figured I'd throw it in there for context). I can't forgive myself for a lot of the things I've done. I don't know how to. I've spent so long punishing myself I don't know how to forgive myself. I want to get better. I want to be happy and have a stable relationship with my son again. I just don't even know where to start.

however, she said that antidepressants DO work for her and makes her happier and all that stuff. so i was wondering, if it does work, is it better if i stay out of it? or are there still ways i can support her? besides the basics like patience and listening. 

thank you!!","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Feeling at the end of the line,"Hello everyone, I posted my story in r/depression and a user was kind enough to point me here to get some help (thanks a lot friend), so this is my story.

I (35 male) was raped as a child by an uncle 7 years my senior, I think I was 8 or 9, the trauma locked my memories from 2 to 3 years (between the incident and subsequent years). I didn't confront the issue till I was 24 and a girlfriend that I used to talk to and sort of wanted something more were talking about our feelings and I just plained told her what had happened to me and she told me that something similar happened to her at a similar age, we cried and talked about it and other things, strangely even as we felt closer after this we went our separate ways being just good friends to this day (she is married, lives in a different country and has a baby), after that I worked through my trauma alone with little success (side note, there is a history of violent tendencies in the men of my family, both from my mother's and father's side, and I'm basically the mixed result).

A couple years later I met my first long relationship girlfriend and as you can imagine I fell hard for her and spoiled her like crazy, she helped my reconnect with my father and I told her about my trauma and to my surprise she also was a victim, we both tried to get professional help within our means but only I got serious about it and kept going to my sessions, she said she was fine on her own and knowing how hard this was I let her take her own choice and just tried to be supportive when needed, needless to say it ended bad, near the end when we were about to move in together I tried to start a conversation about how we began getting together and how special she was to me, apparently I was the only one that felt that way because she told me that the only reason she kissed me and begun hanging out with me was because she felt pity for me, we had other issues like a poor sexual life and not enough time on her part for us, so after she told me about how we really had begun our relationship I felt numbed and after a few days in emotional hell I broke up with her, I listed all that was wrong with the relationship and told her that something that begins with pity can't have a future, I wasn't able to tell her that that was what hurt me the must, she never apologized and we went our separate ways, her family loved me and knew I was the good guy and I was the best for her and tried to help but never went passed of a small conversation with me, they were harder on her but in the end they are her family, I found out she also cheated later on and it was what killed the last pieces of love I had for her, I didn't confront her about it and we never spoke ever again, the pity confession destroyed my self confidence (we were together for close to 4 years).

So after that and having gotten some more help with my trauma I went on the quest to become the best version of me and was doing ok, over a year later I meet my current wife, a person so beautiful that has made me feel what is real love and allowed me to love freely again, but another kind of problems fell onto us, financial problems. I am an engineer (developer), my family is middle class my father is a pediatrician and my mother is a fisiotherapyst, I also have a sister 4 years my junior and we live in a third world country (Bolivia) so we had enough but never had luxuries, my wife in the other hand had a worst time growing up, her father was a taxi driver and her mother is a school teacher assistant with two more brothers so they were basically poor with just enough to get by. 

When we got together we swore to work hard so we can give our selfs and our families a better life than the one we knew. As I mentioned I have anger issues and while I was working one day my boss called me to his office just to yell at me about a complain I presented to management about an issue with my laptop, I used to use my personal laptop to work in the office because they couldn't provide one for me and when it broke I asked them for a replacement, apparently this was out of line for them and he just begun insulting me with my colleagues hearing everything in the next room, I almost lost it but kept it together just enough to put myself face to face with him and asking him to repeat everything closing my fist ready to beat the shit out of him, he just stayed silent and I laughed at him and just turned away, a few weeks later I was fired (if you think I should have reported him and the company I did but keep in mind this is Bolivia, there is no justice for anyone who doesn't have money) so until today I haven't been able to get another stable job and we basically just live with the food our families give us and small jobs I got and everything goes to pay the bills, on top of this, about a year and a half into our relationship when we moved in together and a month before getting fired we got a loan from the bank to began a business together and when she was set to go and make a deposit to buy our merchandise her uncle got notice of this and robbed her like a common thief (yeah you read that right), so we went into debt with no job and no business, police and family where notified but the scumbag flew the country (to Peru as far a we know). 

My wife knows about my rape and thanks to her I was able to talk to my sister about it too, needless to say I broke my sister's heart but also made us closer, she also was kind enough to pay for private professional help for me and her to deal with this, I also opened about this with an uncle (my mother's brother) who I thought was someone completely different to what he turned out to be, when I told him about the rape he broke hard and I took him to talk with the therapist I was seeing thanks to my sister, and what she told me before (the therapist) and told to him later changed everything, she said that I needed some sort of compensation for what had happened in order to move on, it wasn't possible to get legal justice due the time frame of the events and the lack of evidence beyond my word and she didn't suggest anything more beyond that we should try to figure it out, of course telling the whole family was my first thought and let the truth have its day, but my uncle (mother's brother) begged me not to tell anything because it would destroy the family, specially my mother who has a lot, and I mean a lot of love for the uncle who raped me, she (my mother) basically raised him the first 4 years of his life because his parents had a busy and privileged life and he (the rapist) is seen by the rest of the family as a great guy and an example, with this he (mother's brother) convinced me not to tell anything, I know I could have just said no and told everything to everyone but thinking what could I possibly put my mother through after seeing how his brother took the news made me feel trapped and basically I've been living feeling like a prisoner and the responsible for my entire family being together or not.

My dear wife, my love, only she keeps me sane holding me when I'm about to broke and unfortunately with all that I've mentioned before about not being able to get a job it has begun to be a frequent occurrence and I can see it is taking a toll on her, I've busted my eyes and my back studying and working hard on small jobs non related to my career just to keep us going and whenever seems to be an opportunity all I get are rejections or I get to watch people getting jobs because of political favors, and what has led me here is the thought that I am the common factor in all of this, and everyone specially my wife would be better off if I am no more, we would love to be able to begin a family but it would be so irresponsible to bring a child to this world under this circumstances, and this also makes my wife so sad, she cries in my shoulder but tells me that we will pass this and everything will be fine, but I've lost almost all hope, and given our age and financial situation it looks that if she keeps being by my side she will never have the family and the life she deserves.

What I humbly ask from whoever is reading are some words of advice or encouragement or a slap in the face if it is what is needed (not that i haven't got lots of them as well) but I don't know, I'm lost, I'm at the edge.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Today I was one step away from killing myself.," Today I was one step away from killing myself.  
Long story short - I had a girl-friend. We've been best friends for 7 years. The first 2 years I treated her only as a friend, but after 2 years I realized that I fell in love with her. Almost immediately I told her about it and was sent to the friend zone. But every year I fell in love with her more and more. I have never loved anyone so much, and I have never had such a friend. This year she found herself a new boyfriend. And in the end, she said that she no longer has time to communicate with me, and it would be better if we stop communicating.  
She threw me away like trash.  
I was left without friends, in a deep depression, absolutely psychologically broken. Every night I fall asleep with the thought that I want to die in my sleep, and every morning I regret that I am still alive.  
The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is my family. I know that if I commit suicide, my parents will not survive it.  
But today she posted a photo on Instagram, where her boyfriend picks strawberries, with the caption ""Happiness is when your man collects strawberries for you while you chill on the bench.""  
And at that moment I was more than ever close to ending my life. For a minute, I stopped thinking about my parents, about anything else, and just wanted to go and cut my throat, or veins.  
Every day I want to live less and less, because I no longer have a future, there are no hopes and dreams, and I am drowning in darkness and depression.  
I don't think I can endure this until the end of the year and not end up with my miserable aimless existence.   
And so that everything is not so depressing - I am absolutely seriously going to get myself 2 tattoos this year: a small trash can somewhere on my leg, and the inscription ""Loser"" on my arm. Because if I have understood anything over the past 11 years, during which I have visited 8 friend zones, it is that I am a loser, but this year I realized that I am trash","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
“I Don’t Care What You Think… This Is Between Me And God Now.”,"I have always looked up to my older cousin, Jim. He was truly one of “the three men I admire most” (credit Don McLean’s ‘“American Pie”). 

And then, as if my current struggles with depression haven’t been bad enough, this week he tore me apart over a situation that he was completely ignorant about. He took one person’s totally distorted version of events (a diplomatic way of saying that he believed someone else’s delusional lies) and wouldn’t even consider my side of the story. 

I tried so hard to get him to understand what I was doing and why. But he just wouldn’t listen and continued to so very unfairly condemn me. 

Jim hurt me so badly. And he broke my heart. 

I was at a loss for what to do next. Then I thought about what my Dad would say in a similar situation. He wasn’t a very big man physically, but he was one tough little SOB. And though he passed three years ago, I still find comfort and inspiration from his words of wisdom. 

So I told Jim that I’ve given this situation a great deal of thought and prayer. I’m doing what I believe is right. And if he doesn’t like it, with all due respect, I don’t care. This is between me and God now. 

Jim had no answer. And his abusive attacks stopped.

How do I find a path that’s right for me?,"I’m 35, and I work for my dad doing maintenance on low income (read falling apart-run down, bug infested pits for the most part) housing. I swore growing up working with my dad that I’d never end up here. Somehow, some way I’d find some way to make a living and support myself in some way that involved more mental work and air conditioning. I always thought I’d be a writer, but since about 25 when I had a mental health crisis I’ve had no inspiration (barely the aspiration to remain alive for a long time, I just existed; very depressed, in no small part because I was doing this same work).
I have a college degree, but it’s a bachelor’s in “Culinary Arts”. Essentially it’s useless as anything but wall art, but it was important to me to finish college regardless of how depressed I was. The program gave me an easy couple semesters when I couldn’t stand being.
I always thought some inspiration would hit, or some brick would fall onto my head and I’d see clearly what I should do with my life.
I remember tearful prayers at 14, asking God for some kind of guidance that never came. I didn’t know then and I don’t know now what I’m going to do when I grow up (… 35, in case you forgot).

Staying POSITIVE is ALREADY hard and now I am the caregiver to a SUICIDAL FRIEND,"Hi guys, I don't know if this is the right forum for my overall mixed content. I'm 23 \[F\]. And I need some advice on my situation. Appreciate it if y'all could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story.   


Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend.  I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good r/s with her family.  


I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didn't work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news - she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldn't do anything (in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide). However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly (I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate). They eventually texted back to express their gratitude but I did not hear from them afterwards...   


So again, she had her bouts of episode and meltdowns and I had to calm her down every single time. it gets exhausting for me as well. And I always feel that I am trying to fight against absorbing and feeling down from all of these. Recently, she went for a staycay and her mum called me. She was begging me to ask my friend to cancel it to which i have no influence on at all since my friend was  really optimistic about this (she initially had plans to kill herself during this trip but after meeting another psychologist, she kind of is delayin it). When her mum called me a second time, i was with my friend and my friend was really on the edge. She tried taking my phone away from me to talk to her mother but I stopped her. Her mum SAID thru the phone ""since i didn't know she is with you and you are still going to allow her to go for the staycay, ALL is on you. YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF SMTG HAPPENS TO HER. I DONT CARE but you make sure she is safe."" I was quite upset by this but politely ended the call as my friend tried grabbing the phone away from me.  Ended up, she called her mum back only to shout and scream at her mum - berating the mum for calling me. Her mum was upset. The mum texted me and blamed me for my friend's action. I replied to her saying I was sorry that that happened and that I tried calming my friend but she went hysteria instead. The mum later replied telling me that since my friend does not listen to her as a mother, i should be the one doing the advice and guiding my friend to the so called 'right path'. She said that she leave me to take care of my friend for her.   


Im speechless guys.. I am so exhausted already but yet this happened?? It felt like the mum is just giving up on her daughter?? I fr am so lost on what i should do. Becos tbh, Im also slowly going back into depression and some of my friends has been trying to contact me but I am trying to get away from everyone. I know im burntout but i really feel like shit. I am jobless and im trying to move on with my life but i have to be on my toes in case my friend kills herself. FYI i have since stopped seeing my therapist becos i wanted to focus fully on this friend. I also have called different hotlines available online but lets be real - they kept telling me to call the police when she is in danger. Like I want to know what else I can do y'know.

I'm not sure how to tell my mother I'm depressed,"Trigger warning (NSFW) : there will be mentions of self harm

Before anyone jumps to any conclusions please know I love my mother. She's has an interesting way of handling situations. She just wants best for me and everyone and doesn't know how to handle certain situations. 

I think the beginning was 7th grade. It's the age when I'm told kids around my age go through their adolescent stage. They become defiant of their parents and so forth. I'm not sure if this is applicable for everyone but I was one of the kids who defied their parents and acted like a brat. I'm certain from grade 7 it was just my teenage phase but now I'm not sure because at grade 8 and 9 these mood swings got progressively worse and I began to act more sad than just moody. 

In grade 9 I ended up going to the office to have a talk with the counselor. Don't shame me for this but I had just began to use social media and my account was small so only my friends knew my account. Maybe it was for the better but I had posted on my story that I was going to c*t myself for everyone friend of mine. (During this time my family was in the rough. My parents were talking about divorce because they were living apart for too long and their gears just didn't click well together after being apart for too long and just recently getting to live with each other.) I don't know what had gotten to me (because I probably shouldn't have posted such a sensitive topic) but I posted it but didn't completely follow through with it. I did very minor scratches. Maybe I was seeking comfort and attention. Anyways, I had posted it, this concerned my friends and it went all the way to the schools counselor and I ended up having a talk. 

I just bawled during the counsel meeting and asked if this would get to my parents and the counselor said yes. I didn't want to let my parents know because it would simply add fuel into the fire with my parents constantly talking about divorce. Anyways long story short this got to my parents and things got just a bit messier. My parents fought and mentioned my ""problems"" and blamed one another and it was difficult. 

(For those curious my parents didn't divorce they apologized with each other and made up)

After I had arrived home from the counsel meeting I had a talk with both my parents. It was funny because my dad asked me if he could see the c*ts and told me he used to have depression like me and told me he understood. My mom on the other hand was informed by the counselor I was recommended to see a therapist and my mom said, her words: ""teens hitting their puberty stage"". The counselor once again pushed the idea of meeting a counselor and had a small heated debate with my mom about it. My mom backed off and said she would meet one and left with me. We got in the car and the first thing my mom mentioned was that I wasn't going to see a therapist. She said a bunch of things about being upset she didn't know I was going through this and thought it was just me being pubescent but ultimately she was telling me she didn't believe in mental issues. 

She told me I wasn't depressed and that I was just pubescent. Grade 9 and 10 ended relatively smoothly with no self harming just minor break downs and uncontrollable mood swings. Grade 11 came and my previously clean record had relapsed. To this day despite having recently graduated I still unfortunately self harm as a way to cope from unstable emotions. 

The counselor told me I was depressed and have anxiety and others who listened to my rants and stories have told me similar to what the counselor said. 

I'm not sure what to do seeing I have doubts that I have depression because I'm comparing my issues to others and I currently don't understand myself with constant emotional numbness and random attacks of sadness. 

I wish to seek therapy but can't without my parents approval. My mother still doesn't believe in mental disorders and issues and I can't talk to her about these issues because she will take them as me talking back to her. 

I can't talk to my dad either because he will end up talking to my mom about it. 

Should I talk to my mother about my depression, self harm and seek therapy? If so how should I approach my mother without her telling me I'm just going through my pubescent stages (still) and making up a story. 

Sorry if this story sounds dumb.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
I don't want to do this anymore,"Tw here, this post includes talk about suicide


Im so exhausted. Life just doesn't seem liveable to me anymore. I feel as if I can't feel anything other than sadness and jealousy. I'm so jealous of other people's lives. I'm nothing I ever wanted to be. I wish I was a boy, I wish I was someone more attractive, I wish I had a better personality, I wish I wasnt so talentless and useless. Suicide feels like the only way out. I want to be happy but it seems near impossible Everyday is the exact same as the day before.There's no one here for me irl anymore. No one believes my feelings are real. I've been told that because I am 14, my emotions are all based on hormones and therefore aren't serious and shouldn't be taken seriously. I feel alone. And I feel like there's nothing for me here. I don't want to be here anymore. For as long as I can remember I've been dealing with mental health issues. I don't even remember what it was like before. I'm honestly desperately looking for a reason to stay because as if right now I see no reason. I want things to be better.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
All I want - is my death,"Good day, everyone. This is not my first post on reddit regarding my problem. Long story - short: I had a girl-friend. We have been friends for 7 years. She was my best friend. We supported each other in everything and always helped each other. But, as often happens, I fell in love with her. And I ended up in the friend zone, of course. For the last 5 years I have been with her in the friend zone. Although at one point it became clear that I could get out of her if I was more persistent - she herself told me about it. But things went downhill this year. She found a boyfriend and spent all her free time with him. I, in turn, turned into a bunch of depression and occasional jealousy. And in the end, a month ago, she said that we both understand that this cannot continue. That we need to end our communication, and I will only feel better if she disappears from my life.  
Today I tried to write to her and make up, to offer her just friendship, communication on the network and nothing more, because I need her very much. But she refused me. And she did it with such contempt, with such hatred. She said that she did not need this communication, that over the past month she understood. that she hasn't needed it for a long time. So in the end, she doesn't even need me as a friend. I really thought that everything would work out, and we would be at least friends again. But I was wrong. She doesn't need me, in any form.  
Now it is difficult for me to think and do anything at all. I practically cannot go outside, because almost immediately I feel anxiety and, often, I start having panic attacks even if I just go out into the garden next to my house. Because I immediately start thinking that she is out there somewhere, with her new boyfriend. I can’t read, watch movies, I can’t play games, because my thoughts are occupied with something completely different. I need to write my dissertation, and I cannot concentrate, because my thoughts are not at all about studying. Over the past six months, I started having mental problems, and I cannot find the strength in myself even to go to a psychiatrist. And on the one hand, I would very much like to forget her, because I know that we will never even communicate with her now. On the other hand, I am so afraid to forget her, because for me she was the center of my universe. Hell, really, if I really had the opportunity to kill myself, if I had a bad relationship with my family, if I didn't know that my family would not survive this, I would go and kill myself at that very moment, when she said she didn't want to talk to me anymore. What I really would like right now is some inoperable cancer just to slowly fall into the grave. I'm 26, and I have never been fully reciprocated by one girl. I visited 8 friend zones. But the most offensive is this one, the last one. Because I'm an idiot. I know that she could be mine if I was more persistent. Now, I look at myself 5 years ago and want to shout to myself ""Idiot! You ruin everything! Take a step!"", But I can't, because I'm not a magician. I don't think so, but I know that I will never be happy in my life. That I would work a job that I would hate until my parents were gone. And right after that, I'll just kill myself, because it won't make sense for me to stay alive anymore. My sisters by this time will already be married, and will be able to live without me. Over the past six months, my life has sunk to such a bottom, into such an abyss, where it has never been before. And in the last month my life has ended. Only existence remains. The man who hoped for the future, who had dreams and hopes, is dead. And I, an empty shell filled with regrets, pain and depression - for some reason still alive. All I want is to die. And I can never want anything else again. All that remains for me is to live my existence in darkness and depression until the moment when I can finally finish it all. My only regret is to meet my end as soon as possible.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

I just keep going back to bed and then if I get out of bed it’s to have a cigarette. Feeling so lost and struggling to feel genuine in my emotions whether that’s in my relationship or around friends. I just feel like I’m watching the world go by when I used to have so much determination of what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be.

Inability to care about anything,"I don’t know what it is or how to phrase it properly but I seem to completely unable to care about anything.

i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body.,"
maximus came home almost four years ago, after enduring years of abuse. he was a 90 pound hunk of love who thought he weighed about 5 pounds. most handsome boy youve ever seen, a pitbull with the biggest block head that i love more than anything. he always had to be by my side, and i always had to be by his. i would lay on the floor with him any chance i had, and he would always angle his head down and just collapse his body into my lap. my boy loved to get dressed up- a bandana around his neck always made him sit up a little taller, and walk a little prouder. 

he got a rough start, having been used as a bait dog for the first half of his life. his body was permanently marked with scars from where evil scum had cut him repeatedly. when we found each other at the shelter, he had been there for 9 months and been adopted out and taken back quite a few times. ill never be able to wrap my mind around the fact no one else kept him, but im so thankful they didnt and that he waited for my family. he was missing almost all his teeth from chewing rocks, and was blind in his left eye. he has seen and experienced the worst humankind has to offer yet still had more love for us than you could ever imagine. he was my big, goofy, happy happy guy. the biggest regret i have is that i didnt get to him sooner than i did. 

Maximus didnt want to eat anything the past few days, and was more sluggish than usual. my mom took him to the vet yesterday just to make sure nothing was actually wrong, and they told us his red blood count was low and he needed a blood transfusion. it was serious but no reason he wont recover from it. we took him from there to emergency vet, where they ran tests and did scans. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into “tumor lysis crisis” meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. 

the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover- putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. he’s been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. 

we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. 

we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cant remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. 

my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. 

my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. 
i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100%. i genuinely dont think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. 

im back home now, my other dogs don’t understand why their brother isnt here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 3-4 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i wasnt remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i dont feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i dont feel like i wish i wouldve sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have im laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. im not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. im scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i dont ever want to. i tried to memorize everything i could about the way he feels, so i hope its a long time before that happens. but for right now all i can think about is how it felt holding him and petting him and how it felt. 

ive been in a bad depressive state the past few weeks, and i dont know how im ever going to feel okay again. maximus is my comfort, i seek him out when im sad because of the comfort he brings, and now he’s not here to comfort me when i need it the most. 

please be kind to me, im not in a good place right now.

I just someone to hold me. I don’t know anymore.,"
It’s been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I’m leaving. I have no closure and still don’t even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don’t know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I’m a waste of life in their 30’s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don’t have anyone anymore. 

I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don’t spend much time with my family as it’s only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. 

I’ve stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn’t done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it’s been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. 

I think for some people suicide is their life’s purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can’t even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. 

I just don’t understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.  I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it’s time to die. 

I don’t expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
any tips/tricks on how to deal with (this kind of) frustration?,"i feel super frustrated because on a purely rational/logical level i know what i have to do to improve my mental health, like for example being more compassionate towards myself, seeking out help from therapists and doctors, opening up to people around me etc.

but even thinking about doing any of those things feels incredibly daunting and unattainable, like something i will never be able to do.

i know that i probably have to divide any task into micro tasks, which then somehow become more manageable, but even that in it self seems so far out of my current capacity. (planning stuff etc.)

does anyone feel the same? has anyone advice? or is the only way out of it to ""just do it"", in a brute force kinda way?

Should I just indulge?,"I've been working really hard on my mental health for several months now, pushing myself through difficult times to keep taking care of myself.

"I’m sick of everything, my life is just meant to be miserable.","It’s a long post, but I will appreciate any feedback from anyone who decides to read it!

My struggle with depression started around 2017/2018. I’m currently 18yo. Sometimes I’m more stable than the other day, there are the times that I’m capable of controlling how I response to big waves of emotions. But it’s never totally gone, it likes to come back and my behavior is often caused by some unhealed memories or habits from my lowest times. I get embarrassed when I get emotionally involved into a conversation, I hate the thought of making my mental health an excuse, but sometimes I just feel like I just ran a marathon, I lay down and I can’t help but cry because of such a failure my life is and how weak I am.
I have an abusive father, my family and I tried everything to solve problems and help him change but he won’t listen to anyone. Our family is pretty much divided to responsible men (my oldest brother and my father) and women that should do everything around the house so everyone else, especially my father, can live comfortably. I have five siblings. Since I’m the oldest girl I’m expected to be the major housekeeper except my mom. I’m also the one with the most sense of being fair and respectful towards what I have and what’s given to me, that’s why I rarely skip my responsibilities or deny any request or help. I feel overwhelmed about the amount of stuff I need to do, not to mention the way my parents treat me when something is not done perfectly.
I graduated high school with average results, I’m neither the smartest nor the dumbest person on earth. I don’t have any specific abilities nor passions to pick a solid university major that would make me happy and open a career path that would let me sustain myself. Now that I can apply to college, my score is slightly beyond the minimum. I picked a major about Korea, the country and the language, it’s something I got interested in, I am studying Korean for a while. But when I realized how much points you have to have to get accepted I lost any excitement that I had, I barely meet the requirements, most people have tens of points more. I don’t stand out in any way.
I was never liked at school. I felt like outsider wherever I went. Nobody was ever in love with me. I never had a friend, first people that I started to hangout with I met a year ago. For majority of my life I was overweight, at some point I was even obese. I lost over 50lbs (23kg) a year ago and I do everything to maintain my weight on a healthy level. I have to be focused on what I eat, I gain weight in the matter of days. Every cheat day feels like one step closer to my past self. My relationship with food is extremely bad and I don’t know how to change it.
I don’t fit anywhere. I don’t feel good in any place, I shout my mouth around people for them not to be forced to hear about my problems that sometimes spill out through my mouth unintentionally.
Who would want to be around with such a loser for longer anyway?
I met a boy online, after a couple of months we became really good friends. We always have something to talk about, we share so many experiences and he respects me and wants only good for me. I had a hard time with men because of my father, I never believed they would value me or they would use me quickly after getting along. But this guy showed me that there are good men out there, with a softer side and responsible mind. After talking and calling each other for a longer time I realized how safer and calmer I feel now that he’s in my life. Even unconsciously I feel his gentle presence. Now I think that I realized what does love mean and that I have feelings for him. He’s from a different country though. I was saving up for plane tickets and the trip there, I started planning everything in March and look, it’s July and nothing happened. Even though I was researching all the legal information, translating documents, buying necessary things, keeping myself updated on flights, I’m still here. And I have no idea if I will ever get there. There are too many obstacles.
I can’t tell anyone about it besides my friend himself, nobody thinks here that online relationship can be real, if it’s either just friendship or a spark of love. It’s too dangerous and too much risk involved. Can’t disagree, but I don’t think it’s true in our case. Even though it’s been a year, we’re exchanging pictures and we made phone calls and the risk still exists, but it’s limited, but they don’t even want to think about it.
And whoever had someone dear to their heart away for long know how much it hurts when you can’t even see them smiling in real life or hug them when they need it.
I’m a failure. No job, no university perspectives, not a lot of money, best friend 1300 miles away.
Nobody takes my emotional exhaustion seriously, it’s not even a valid argument anywhere. Usually even I don’t believe it is.
I have not the slightest idea what to do with my life. There’s too much pressure on me and I can’t take it anymore. I feel like completely giving up. I was meant to be lonely. My life is just meant to be miserable.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Quit my new job,"Managed to find a job after awhile of searching. Ended up quitting my second day because everything just became too overwhelming.

The job itself wasn't really difficult, but thinking about it and dealing with my colleagues made me want to stop living.

How do I tell my parents I’m depressed,"For context, I’m 19 years old and I’m starting my second year at a community college in August. I want to take a semester off due to an all time low in motivation. I’d rather not wasted my parents money and instead spend that time getting a job, seeing a therapist, working out, really just getting better. The problem with telling them I don’t want to go this semester is I have to have a good reason and I’d rather not lie to them. They know about my anxiety which is hard enough for me to deal with sometimes but them knowing I have depression is a whole other thing. And I know it’s not as bad as my brain is telling me it is but I can’t help it.

I feel alone and I feel like my future is pointless getting to,"Recently my depression has gotten worse and yet I haven’t been able to tell anyone except 2 friends. I just feel like nobody cares about me except my dad , it doesn’t feel like my mom , brother or sister really cares about me and the same goes with my friends. I feel like every time I’m with someone I feel like a ghost and they just care about what I can do and my feelings are just left there untouched and damaged. And another thing is I feel like I’m just gonna have a shit life and what’s the point of reaching the future. I just feel as if what’s the point of living life to be alone , just by myself in a boring job just to make money to live a shit life. The worst part is I have anxiety and I’m not sure if it relates but I could never bring myself to get help or tell my family as I’m just too scared. I could never kill myself (at least at this point in my life) I just feel as if there’s so much shit I can’t be arsed to deal with I just wish that someone would just make me free and either dead or just not have do deal with anything. I just wanted to get this out since I don’t have the courage to get help.also with my friends all they did was tell me to tell someone but they don’t seem to understand that I just cant and I just wish I could get help without having to say anything to anyone. I feel as if I couldn’t let my parents see me this way as it would be… I dont know how to describe it I just couldn’t. At this point I just need some comfort so any would be appreciated a lot.

I can feel happy some days and other days I want to die.,"Hello, I’ve (22F) struggled with my mental health since I was young, I was bullied when I was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. Then I became depressed in my teenage years, but got better when I was 20.

I’ve never been good at interacting with people, due to my anxiety I find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people, but at the same time I can get defensive over anything, like I feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality they’re just joking around. A lot of people don’t like me because of that, I seem really mean but I’m not, I wish I could be friends with people like a normal person but I just can’t. 

Lately I’ve been having good days and bad days, but exaggerated. When I’m having a good day I feel amazing, I’m productive and do a lot of things. But in my bad days I feel way too bad, I was clean (from self harm) for 4 years and I did it again like a week ago. When I feel bad I also can’t stop thinking I want to die, I feel like no one will ever like me, I’ll never get a job because I run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety. I just want to disappear but I don’t want to kill myself because I don’t want my family to suffer. 

TL;DR: I don’t know if I’m depressed or not, I have motivation a lot of days but some days I become suicidal and I think it’s all because of my anxiety","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
How to find/keep a job when you’re severely depressed/struggling.,"How do people find/keep a job when they’re depressed and/or struggling with debilitating mental illness? I apply to so many jobs &amp; I have bills to pay. I’m basically out of money this month after leaving my previous job. I even left that job due to feeling so inadequate, the inability to just get the fuck out of bed, among all of the other things/feelings that come with being so trapped in my own head it feels like. 

I feel like I need somebody to slap me into reality. I don’t understand how people can continue to show up to these jobs that they hate every single day. I don’t know how people bite back their fear of looking fucking dumb. I try so hard to be a functioning member of society but I’m failing so hard. I don’t know how to swallow that pill &amp; I feel so underprepared for adulthood. I’ve been depressed and struggling with this for so many years now. It really started in adolescence, around 13-14. I’m 23 now and feel like such a damn failure knowing that I haven’t changed much at all since then. 

If anybody has any advice or comments that may help me would be really appreciated because I don’t know what to do at this point.

Lost,I was diagnosed with cancer around June 2020 I finished treatment some months ago . During that time I realized my “friends” were t my friends.

Please help me I don’t know what to do,"So for the past month my boyfriend has gone from the happiest boy alive to completely silent, always down, constantly tired, never feeling social and just very sad- he’s slipping into a depression- I know what that feels like and it’s scary he is going through it

About 2 weeks ago he started strictly shirts, no swimming, no showers, no changing, he stopped wanting to be intimate with me, never took his clothes off in front of me- until the other night he just completely broke down crying, saying sorry and that he just needed to cuddle- I just kept telling him I loved him- and eventually he finically started to get tired and we started mucking around

I went to tickle him on the stomach and he got very aggressive and defensive- pushing me away saying no, don’t put your hands there, please don’t look- I know it was probably wrong but I kept pushing until he gave up and he just started tearing up again- there are cuts all over his abdomen and more on the sides of his legs

I just hugged him and told him I loved him until we fell asleep

But I don’t know what to do, I’m so scared, I’ve been where he is before- I have self harmed too- I’m just so scared and I don’t know what he is going to do- he has never had any sort of mental illness before and I think he’s really struggling- I wanna help but I know how hard it is to stop and I just… I’m scared he is going to kill himself if I don’t do something","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
Starting a new job with depression,"I’m seeking some advice. I recently started a new job. 

I’m suffering severe depression at the moment which has worsened after a breakup (bit of background, I’ve suffered from depression on and off for the last 10+ years). Unmediated right now - thinking of going back back but afraid of going back to my old cycles. I’ve been in some very dark places recently and have regular ideation. I’m okay right now - I’m lucid and not distressed or apathetic to the point of wanting to end things.

As mentioned, I recently started a new job. A promotion in my current company. My HR team is aware of my history and medical record. But I’m finding it hard at the moment to settle into my new role. I’m swinging between showing enthusiasm and working to prove myself to complete apathy and disinterest in any kind of future it might bring me. It’s making things really hard for me. It’s like a part of me doesn’t care at all, even though the doors are opening for me to do the things I’ve wanted to do for such a long time. I can’t seem to find any kind of joy. I feel grateful to my new boss for the opportunity and I know I’m just onboarding so it’s still early but there’s a part of me that doesn’t care if I crash and burn. It’s like I’m waiting for it. I want to keep fighting and find myself again but I don’t know how.

how to make him feel like he’s not a burden,"I have a loved one with depression. When he pushes me away, I say stubbornly that I’ll stay. But he says that he’s a burden. How do I assure him he’s not?? Saying “you’re not a burden” is not very convincing.

Also I try to be positive and motivational and he tells me not to. what should I do then? I don’t know what to say.

He says his efforts for the relationship clearly don’t make me happy so trying harder is worse for him and me moving forward.

Are antidepressants the nuclear option?,"Hi, I was in a serious car accident recently and walked away but I'm left with some long term health issues that will take months to resolve because of waiting lists (UK based). The health issues mean I can't take part in my main hobby as I've been told that partaking in that hobby will lead to a worsening of the medical issue and lead to permanent damage.

Over the last few weeks, I've been struggling. I'm low and on the verge of tears all day every day. I can't concentrate, I have brain fog, I forget what I'm doing constantly, I have real trouble making any type of decision. I have a stressful job which requires me to be at my best, and I'm not managing it very well. I take no enjoyment in anything I do, I'm avoiding family and friends. The more time that passes, the worse I feel. I'm guilty that I don't feel relieved that the outcome wasn't worse, I'm angry that someone else's (other driver's) poor decision making has put me here. My friends and family (my partner in particular) are worried about me as I am not myself, I feel guilty about this too but can't bring myself to feel normal so I avoiding speaking to them.

I'm on a waiting list for counselling, and I've been having regular catch ups with my doctor, but this week I spoke with someone new and within 5 minutes of speaking to me for the first time, she told me my symptoms suggested depression and prescribed antidepressants with a suggested minimum course of 1 year. I have a family history of depression, but this is the first time that I have been here, and medication feels like a huge step, especially seeing as she mentioned taking them for a year. I just want to get back to feeling like myself again, but what I have heard about antidepressants suggests that they won't be the magic fix.

They were not to be discussed in public. They were a private matter. Sadly. I never felt I had anyone to talk too. I have finally accepted I have suffered depression most of my life. I am seeing a therapist who is helping me unpackaged my childhood reasons for shutting down. Now my partner of 21 years wants me to open up and really communicate how I am feeling and what I want.  I was wondering what advise anyone has to reconnect with my emotions. Understand what I am feeling? I haven't really known anything but sadness and shame.,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What is the point?,"I have been suffering from depression i suppose all my life. However, acknowledgment of it only came 3-4 years ago. Since acknowledging i have depression, each passing year since I get worst and worst. These last two years have been my lowest with contemplation of harm getting harder to ignore. 

My 30th birthday was earlier this year and 4 days leading to it the idea of not seeing that birthday was painfully strong. I have no social life. the one friend that i confided in, that relationship has drastically changed. I have no romantic life, and havnt dated in 6 years. and i have no career, recently quitting my job as my mental health plumited, however now i dont think i am good enough for any job so the motivation to look just brings about anxiety and self hate. 

Note that i have been on lexapro for the last 5 months with my dossage being raised last week, and although it helps regulate my moods a littler better, I am still incredibly sad and hate the pathetic state of my life. I also started therapy the same time i got the perscription and see them one a week. However, although talking out my feelings gives me temporary relief i still dont know the tools needed to be better. 

I am incredible lonely and don’t want to feel this heaviness and self hatred anymore.

I guess the reason for my post is to find out if anyone has genuinely overcome their depression to the point that they can say they are truly happy. Or is this something I will have to fight with for the rest of my life, because if it is then what is the point?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Should I feel like a loser,"Basically the title. I’m 21F, and going to post my life story I guess. Thank you for any advice, or just being honest. I feel like a failure.

I’ve never had a job. Even in high school I just wanted to focus on doing good in school, not splitting my time for some minimum wage fast food job, but I guess everyone else in the world already had a job in high school. I still don’t have a job, have never tried to apply/get an interview, and now I feel like I don’t even have time for one. I’m going to be in college full time again next month, I don’t drive anymore, I just don’t see the point. Should I be even more miserable and have less time for school just so I can finally “check the box” of having a job?

I don’t drive anymore. I did it everyday for 2 years with no real problems but then the stress wasn’t worth it anymore. I hate the gravel roads/potholes of this town, hate driving on ice for 10 months of the year, I just don’t ever want to deal with the stress again. I’ve lived with my parents ever since the pandemic, and of course not being able to drive makes me feel like I don’t have any agency or independence. Can’t go to school or a job because I feel like a huge burden and failure whenever I ask them to take me anywhere.

I don’t have any friends and don’t really feel worthy enough to have any, but I’ve accepted that for a while. I feel so ugly and worthless and I think any reasonable person would probably agree. I have nothing to offer.

I guess I’m going to email a therapist again soon, even though I have no health insurance and certainly don’t have the money to just spend. I was trying to save my student loan money but I don’t even know what the point is anymore.

Thanks for reading. Just really not enjoying anything lately, and I can’t really get “out into the world” at all because there’s no in-person classes, nothing to do, and I feel like a burden every time I ask for something from my parents when they’re working.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

How do you heal from the trauma of being unloved and emotionally neglected by your parents?,"Hello everyone, so I've been depressed and lonely for a more or less long time. I fought a lot with loneliness especially, because it's an issue I keep coming back to, even if I manage to tend to my various other issues well enough. It's the loneliness that dwells on me the most.

I attempted to deal with my loneliness by trying to make friends and specifically by trying to find a romantic partner. I know what self-love is about and I know the premise behind it, which is to be able to be okay with not having anyone, because you're supposed to fill your life with your own love. 

But here is where I keep running into an issue: No matter how much effort I'd put into this, it would never be enough. There is no such thing as a ""void in my heart"" which everyone seems to talk about. I would say my heart feels pretty intact, actually. I'm pretty fine with who I am. And I'm told this is enough, because you can't possibly achieve a state where you genuinely *love* yourself, unless you're narcissistic. You can like yourself and enjoy your company, yes. And I do believe this is where I'm at right now.

And yet, I'm still looking for someone else. An intimate companionship. A certain sense of belonging. And this is when it suddenly dawned on me: Those are the things my parents could never give me.

What do I do about this? How can one heal from this trauma?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

A bit of background I was unemployed for a few months last year and this January finally got full time work again.

Im am being paid a decent wage but I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth it. Every day I wake up dreading the following 8 hours and on my days off I feel like I can never truly rest.

Got rejected from my desired program,"Hi, I was bullied and betrayed by probably all the people I thought I loved and was also living with my abusive dad when I was attending my last year of high school. This caused me to be severely depressed and suicidal during that year, but miraculously I still managed to get in to my dream school which happened to be UBC (Canadian school).

Anyways I was accepted into the Sauder School of Business in UBC and went there right after high school. However, that was the WORST decision of my life because I was still severely depressed and suicidal by the time university came around and scored the lowest marks of my life. I'm talking about me being a 95% GPA student in high school going straight to a 55% GPA student in university, and also failed a science course (my favorite subject btw). This happened because the whole first term, I stayed in bed so much (resulting in missing class), barely showered, ate irregularly, and refused to hand in assignments just because I (subconsciously) wanted to self-sabotage myself or something. 

This really screwed my grades up, but thankfully I started seeing a psychologist and also got antidepressants and they helped me function normally after my first term in my first year. Ever since then, I've tried my best to correct my mistakes and raise my GPA, been scoring mostly A's and B's (I managed to get my GPA up to 75%) but that first term just... drags me down still. 

I recently applied to change programs to science because I realized business is just NOT for me, and I want to do science... but I got rejected due to my failed course and my past 55% GPA for the first 5 courses I ever took in university.

I'm already one year behind because of my decision to change programs but now I'll be 2 years behind because of this rejection ( I have to reapply for the next year ). I'm broke and poor and have to pay more debt the longer I stay in school :/ I don't even know if I'll be accepted next year when I reapply...

Anyone have any advice for me? I'm so lost... I feel like even when I function normally, depressed me from the past will always drag me down and bring me back to that state...","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1
I need help communicating with my depressed wife.,"I love my wife. I really do. It breaks my heart that our ability to communicate has broken down entirely. Everything I say runs through a negativity filter and gets interpreted as personal attack. Seriously.

I've been told I'm too logical. (Which might have some situtational truth to it.) Not all conversations call for logic, and I probably do apply these processes to more wishy-washy, emotional conversations than I should. But I'm working on not always trying to be Mr. Fixit.

That I overthink and analyze things that don't need to be analyzed. (Which I think I know what she's getting at, but I'm unaware of any problem that was solved by not analyzing possible solutions.) I know not every complaint is a request for a fix. But when it's a constant refrain of complaint for weeks or months, maybe it's time I tried to help alleviate?

And that I talk too much and don't listen. So I make active efforts to listen and say nothing. Even when painful and untrue accusations are flung at me. Like supposed infidelity or that I don't love her anymore because her depression has caused her to gain a few pounds by over indulging on icecream. Even when I feel like I should tell her those ideas and accusations are not only unhelpful, but deeply untrue, and hurtful to me, I just take them on the chin, because when I have attempted to reassure her of their falseness, in the past, that I still love her, that's taken as needless contradiction and proof that I dont listen.

In response to these accusations, I'll respond something like, ""Okay, I'll just listen then. How does that make you feel?"" 

And I get the angry response of, ""See!? Just like that! You've always got an answer for everything!""

I have to be missing some piece. How can I promise to only listen, and ask a question, and by the time it gets to her ears, it has mutated into an antagonistic criticism or correction. I feel like I'm totally locked into a Twilight Zone episode.

How do I communicate with someone that will reject the behavior they just asked for? Who will not engage in the kind of conversation they stated that they needed.

Sorry for the wall of text. But it's not a straightforward problem.

Living with my parents is sucking the life out of me.,"Hi. F21 here. I've been suffering from depression for god knows how long. I live in a 3rd world country, so therapy here ain't an option if you're not insanely rich, which I'm not. My parents split up in very bad terms, but still live together since none of them have any other place to go than this, so you can imagine how it is.

Both of them bitch about each other secretly behind each other's back a.k.a. with me. Since my older brother leaves for work early and comes home late, my parents have literally no one else to talk to but me. I understand that totally and try to listen to them as best as I can. But they bitch about how the other one suck, what they do bad, how inconsiderate and ridiculous they are, etc. My dad does this more often. 

Also, I feel like my dad has become incredibly lazy. He's 60, retired but is in perfect physical shape, in general. I know there are things that he shouldn't do anymore, but he literally won't eat anything during the day if no one else is there to cook. ANYTHING. He won't tidy up, he won't even move from his char if he doesn't have to. 

I'm a college student. I got a ton of papers and things to study lately, since it's my second year and I don't always have the time to do things. My mom works until noon and comes back to continue to work. She's a teacher. It's so hard to literally baby sit my dad when I know he's capable of doing simple things like fucking make lunch.I feel super guilty when my mom comes home and there's no lunch, because I was on zoom all morning and my dad didn't do a thing. 

The negativity, the complaints, the bad mood every day for almost two years are sucking the life out of me. I Hut the lowest of depression a couple of months ago when I wasn't even able to move from my bed for weeks. I called sick to school, I barely ate anything. This makes me feels terrible, because before all this, I had the feeling I had finally found control over myself. I worked out, I was in good shape for the first time in my life and I had friends... Now I'm alone in what feels like a labyrinth with no way out. Please, help me. I've cried way more than ever lately. I feel that I have no future, I feel guilty and have thought about suicide so much... I need help.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1
My medications are messing with me,"I’m on Lexapro for my depression because I don’t get enough serotonin in my body causing me to get depressed

But I’m also on Concerta to help with my ADHD which also has serotonin in them

I’ve been taking his medication for so long that they have started to work against themselves causing me to hallucinate and even possible causing me to have Tourette’s Symptoms and causing me to have seizures

We found out I’m not epileptic the only other thing I can be is medication interaction but I can’t stop taking these types of medications I have to take antidepressants and ADHD medications to actually be able to live a somewhat normal lifestyle

I’m really frustrated at the moment but I’m going to talk to my doctor soon and get my medications changed and washed because it’s making me really sick at the moment and messing up my life

And if I don’t have an anti-depressant in my medication Regine I become very suicidal Extremely fast

And on the other end if I don’t have any ADHD medications that is a simulator then I become extremely nasty and can’t control my emotions and I turn into a sheDemon (no exaggeration)

Can't move on. I think it's the end for md,"Hello Reddit. I've come here today to say what I feel in my core, and if I can't take anymore, then may this be my suicide note and my farewell to humankind.
I'm 24 years old, male, Brazilian, and I can't take anymore. 
I think about the only thing I was able to accomplish in my life, failures.
As a middle class person on a average poor country, I always had everything handed. Was handsomely educated thanks to my family's money. Always were quick to learn stuff and was English fluent at 15. However I never managed to be able to study, to take time away from what I felt like doing, which is play video games or playing bass/guitar, and this caused me to have low grades on school, and bring trouble to my relationship with my parents. 
After school I went to college but dropped out because ""it was not what I wanted to work with"". Then I got into another college and dropped out again. I always liked listening and playing instruments, and I've been playing bass since my 16. Decided, then, to become a musician. Turns out I can't study music, just like I couldn't study anything when I was a teenager. 
I work at a shit job that pays me a laughable salary, I don't have any skills that could help me get another job and I am unable to learn any skills from scratch. Everytime I try to learn something, for example, music, I fail.
Nowadays, when I'm not working at my shit job, I am drinking, playing video games or doing any other thing that would make me forget who I am and push the hurtful feeling and thought away.
I can't take this anymore.
I don't know if I'll be alive tomorrow, but I thank every and each one of you who reads this, I have no one else to say what I feel of think.

"I’m so depressed and anxious all the time, what do I do?","
So I know no one on this sub can help my mental health and that’s ok! But I just have no idea what to do with these feelings or thoughts and quite frankly I don’t want to be alive all that much. I’m young, 17 and my life so far hasn’t been as hard as some people’s but it’s not been the best and this last 2 years especially have been shit. Constant battle with what I’m thinking could be adhd, ocd, anxiety and depression (although I’m not diagnosed so im taking most of these titles with a grain of salt until I do) It makes me wonder if all of my adult hood is going to be shit too, I can’t quite imagine myself as the happy version of me I used to be, especially going forward. I see nothing beginning to help me. I’ve tried substances and techniques and they don’t help. Other than weekly therapy and being doped up on some meds I don’t see any other options. 
Has anyone else felt lost, empty, and frustrated in this way and gotten better? Any success stories about conquering mental health?

A bit of a strange case: Exercise has DESTROYED my mental health. Thoughts? Advice?,"





First, some basic health data about myself

Age:16

Sex:Male

Height: 5'10

Weight:Around 142-145 pounds

Ever since the summer of 2019, exercise has been a huge part of my life. My main fitness goal was gaining muscle, so I was doing strength training with weights around three to four times a week. But I also wanted to be able to eat a lot of food and generally have a relaxed diet at the same time. A big reason for that was because my sister had recently recovered from severe anorexia, so my father thought that it would be wise for me to not trigger her and potentially provoke a relapse by following a restrictive diet(by restrictive I mean eliminating junk food, soft drinks, etc.) Because of this, I started doing a lot of cardio, and I really mean a lot. I started out with around 30 minutes of running every other day, but I gradually added more cardio over time. My peak was during the summer of 2020, when I was doing around 2 and a half hours of cardio every other day, in addition to 10 minutes of HIIT on my strength training days. When school started, I cut the duration down to the following routine: alternating between 1 hour of strength training plus 35 minutes of cardio and 95 minutes of cardio every other day. Then, in January 2021, I got a severe knee injury from doing calf raises. Little did I know the day that I injured myself that, from that point on I would descend into the darkest, most hellish part of my 16 years on this Earth. You have to understand that I'd made exercise an essential part of my life. If I didn't complete my exercise, I would fall into a pretty bad mood, sometimes for the rest of the day. So when I injured my knee, I was extremely disappointed. Every form of cardio which I'd been doing and enjoyed(biking and running) was off the table. Judging from prior experience, swimming was also not an option, because I found it(and still do) super boring and torturous. My last cardio option was the rowing machine. I replaced my biking/running with rowing. The problem was that I HATED rowing, even. more than I hated swimming. Every second of my 95 minute sessions felt like torture. The intensity didn't matter, as even super low-intensity sessions made me doubt my sanity.  But, because I'd been so used to doing a huge amount of cardio every day, I literally made myself go to the gym to row.  This sent me into a deep depression. I dreaded waking up every day, as I knew that I would have to go do a torturous rowing session at some point during the day. After watching a video on existentialism and Nietzsche, I decided to completely change my life and viewpoint. I realized that what I'd been doing for the past year and a half or so was INSANE. What was the point of doing so much cardio? I was already fairly skinny, and I had no plans of becoming an athlete. I realized that I needed to live life to the fullest and actually enjoy myself, rather than wake up every day to torture myself. So I completely stopped doing rowing, and reoriented my fitness focus to strength training, the activity which I had enjoyed for so long. But unfortunately, this didn't work out. The toxic attitude I had regarding rowing poisoned my once beloved activity-strength training/lifting. I hyper-focused on the negative aspects of lifting: the pain, the struggle, the discomfort. I no longer enjoyed lifting, instead, I dreaded/hated it. It felt like torture as well. This only worsened my depression, as I realized that NO form of exercise would help, or even just have a neutral effect on my mental health. I took a two-week break from all exercise a couple of weeks ago, and yes, I managed to distract myself with other activities, but when I returned to lifting, my depression returned. Imagine knowing that, for four out of seven days a week, you will be stabbed, shocked, beaten, and tortured. That is how I feel and how I have felt for what seems like so long. I feel like I'm a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, and frankly, I'm surprised that more people haven't killed themselves in that god-forsaken place. I know, it sounds insane, but this is how I feel. It's gotten to the point where recently, I've had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. I don't want to live like this, I can't live like this. How come there are so many people who do intense workouts and don't experience these afflictions? Exercise is supposed to improve one's life, and indeed, that's exactly why I started exercising, but it's having the OPPOSITE effect on me right now. I know that you guys will tell me to see a therapist or specialist of some sort, and trust me, I will be meeting with one soon, but in the short-term, any advice/help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and I hope that you are all having a good day and enjoying your life.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Should I commit myself to a mental hospital?,"TW mention of self-harm/ suicide

My depression has gotten really bad the past few weeks. Suicidal and self-harm thoughts are happening more often, and in general I just feel very gloomy and hopeless and anxious and awful. I’m going through some pretty huge life changes right now as well, so I am really overwhelmed. I can feel myself slipping into a depressive episode, which hasn’t happened in over a year. I am really scared of myself and scared of what might happen if I do not get help soon. I don’t think I will act on my thoughts but still, I thought the same thing a year ago and I was wrong. Not asking for pity I just don’t trust myself to keep me safe, yk?

A month ago I scheduled an appointment with my therapist, but her next available appointment is in another month, and I honesty don’t know what will happen if I wait that long to get professional help. I’m not saying I’m going to kms but I’m just scared for my well-being.

I think staying at a mental hospital would really help me because I just want a break from all of the stressors in my life and I don’t want to lay in my bed all day, which is unavoidable at this point. I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option. I don’t know what else to do, but I really feel like I’m a bomb waiting to blow up. What do you think I should do? I’m just indecisive and bad at trusting my own judgement.

I can feel it coming,"Good evening y'all.

I struggled with depression throughout college. For about a year after college, i struggled with suicidal thoughts.  I discussed this with a therapist and she seemed to indicate it was situational (i was coming out of college into the great unknown of adulthood and was completing a year internship on $500 a month). 

I became an official adult with a night job. The night job did not help the depression. I had insurance now;  told my primary care doctor that i was depressed; she recommended yoga.

 I lost 2 dear people to suicide within 4 mouths of each other. The grief was intense - it's been 10 years. After perhaps 3 years, i started feeling better. Honestly, i felt ok for the past 7 years. 

Covid hit and that was a struggle. I'm located in one of the first hot spots of covid and it was stressful, but I'm ok, my family is ok. 

I've been struggling the past few months. I can feel the depression sending it's roots in. I don't enjoy things. I can't remember shit. I can't determine if my relationship is shit or if it's me. I don't want to be miserable like i was in college.

Being depressed I don’t feel like doing anything
And making music is no longer pleasurable to me. I read somewhere you must practice 1.5 to 2 hours a day on one instrument to see results.

I can’t do that...I can barely play guitar or piano for 15 mins. I also gave up on the bass guitar.
Before I’d just play for hours and write songs
No matter if it was utter shit. I was dedicated.

My goal seems impossible but then I look at multi-talented artists such as Prince, FKJ, Mac Demarco, or Kevin Parker. So it lets me know it’s possible just very hard for me to accomplish.
(Maybe I should stop trying to be like them and be who I am meant to be...but damnit...I bought all these instruments)

I started making music when I was 13. I’m 27 now. I spent many years believing I would have a career in music and never had a breakthrough. Now, since I have depression and all my musical instruments and gear appear to be useless junk, I wish I had fell in love, gotten married and had children. Even learn to drive and get a well paying job. I had bad anxiety growing up so it prevented me from certain aspects of life. Music gave me strength and purpose. Now I’m just lost in life and not sure if things will get better.

I’m currently on disability for my schizophrenia (I was diagnosed around 23) and am currently looking for a part time job. I’m a late bloomer in life. I even still live with my mother. She’s been my caretaker.

So now I’m learning to live without music. It’s very hard. I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I just sit in my room and see all my instruments and studio gear gathering dust and it makes me feel even worse.

All I want to do I sleep. I sleep a lot. I have a tv and video games even but I don’t feel like doing those things to distract myself. I’m gaining weight and I feel awful. Life sucks right now.
It seems I can only do the bare minimum.
I can’t set any big goals because I can’t seem to stick to it.

Any advice to get out this slump?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I give up. Nothing makes me happy.,"I’m so tired. So so tired. The more I think about things, the more I’m convinced that the only way to be happy right now is to pump myself up on drugs. 

I’m a 20 year old mechanical engineering student starting his second year soon. I tried to kill myself twice over seeing my friends in better positions than me, and I don’t think I’ll be able to secure a job that gives me enough money to try all the things I want. I’m not graduating from an Ivy League, I’m not a doctor either, so I won’t make enough to travel the world and do the stuff that Instagram and Reddit always puts on my feed. 

Even if I manage to win the lottery or something, I know nothing compares to the ideals that I make up in my head. Nothing on this earth looks fun or interesting anymore. I just wish I can jump into games or books and live my life there where anything is possible, but here, you don’t expect aliens to take you to worlds beyond your imaginations, superpowers, or to save the world. The way I see it, I’ll just be working my ass off with the occasional vacation until the day I decide to kill myself. 

Because of that, I’m not motivated to try hard enough because I know everything is second best to my expectations. What’s the point of trying if you can’t get what you truly want in the end, just a consolation prize? It’s a vicious cycle, and I feel like a car running on an empty tank when I’m not working for myself, but just for external reasons like not wanting to fucking starve when I graduate. 

I’m ready to leave this fucking earth if I know nothing makes me happy anymore. I’ve learned from my past two attempts, and I think the next one will finally work.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Am I dumb ?,"Hi there. It feels weird to talk about it. 

It’s not very original but I hate myself. Not like a teenager phase anymore because I’m already 25 and I feel like I’ve never accomplished anything. I’m not very pretty and I’m kinda fat (not like those pretty girls who are fishing for compliments, I truly am fat).

Everybody tells me to move my butt, eat less, take care of myself but all I want to do is sleep, or die. I feel like I have nothing for myself. All my friends are drifting away from me because of their couple life and I still don’t know if I’ll ever meet someone I’m important for. I live with my mom and my sister. My mom is sick and my sister is a manipulative piece of crap who gets what the fuck she wants and I can’t help but feel jealous because I never get what I want and no one notices me. Guess it’s a vicious circle because it makes me more bitter everyday and more hating towards people in general because I fear their judgment or being seen as dumb AND unattractive. 

I feel so empty and alone…and then guilty for beating myself for this while people are truly suffering. Wtf is wrong with me ?

I feel like killing myself would be the best option for most people in my life,"Dead end job, schooling that almost only stresses me out, relationships falling apart, and near-constant suicidal thoughts have been making me feel like most people would be better off without me.

Need advice on how to get my mom to see a therapist,"
we're a brown family. needless to say, my mom denies mental health is even a thing. i've been to therapy in the past and taking medications right now. she knows that i do. whenever the topic of my medications comes up, she goes ""idek why you're going to therapy/taking meds, what don't you have that you need all this treatment?"" 
every time i try to explain and send resources, she changes the topic or shows zero interest
my grandfather (mom's dad) was obviously depressed. He made several attempts of suicide. 7 years ago he died of heart attack. my mom hasnt been the same since. she is her funny, joyous self but ever so often she gets extremely emotional-either sad or angry. 
she's a homemaker, lost interest in her hobbies, my dad is so not supportive (in fact is verbally abusive), doesn't have solid friends (not her fault, its hard making friends when you're not well), and my sister isn't the best to her. I havent been home for a LONG time. I only recently came back home. I knew she was slightly depressed but now, observing the way she talks, behaves, her extreme bouts of anger or sorrow makes me think she's depressed or even has a borderline personality disorder. Tbh, she's been this way before her father's death. But now its gotten way worse. Covid isn't helping either. I just need her to be open to the idea of going to a therapist.

feeling kind of depressed (cycle) for a while,"18 year old here.

One day I kind of ‘realized’ there was an ugly aspect of my face (deep set eyes with some hyperpigmentation). I learnt that’s a thing seen mostly in people of color &amp; has to do with facial structure or something like that. I think I had a panic attack because I was crying about it for a while and then became ‘normal’ again. But the next day around the same time the same thing happened..then I was happy again

I‘m of course one of many people who don’t really call themselves ‘pretty’ and never really considered it. But right now I’m thinking maybe if I get therapy and stay there for as long as possible, I’ll feel somewhat better or calm. I won’t fall back into the cycle of feeling depressed about it, it was kind of traumatic. Don’t really think it‘s Body dysmorphia, or could it be? I don’t really care about looks too much. But I hate seeing my face most of the time. I’ve even been listening to/using affirmations &amp; frequencies on YouTube recently to change that ugly aspect so I can just look pretty ok.

In other words it just sucks. I guess for some people (many people obviously) genes didn’t work out so well. Wish I looked better. Then I would be carefree and not worry about this. Don’t even know what I really am actually. Should people like me just give up..maybe not because I do have other interests which at least are entertaining. I like drawing, making edits &amp; watching videos, etc.

Advice on how to deal/make progress,"So, I'm currently in a hole with my depression, and I could use some advice on what to do and ideas on how to approach things, as I've done a lot already. It's a bit of a story, but I will keep it as brief as possible. If you're reading this and want to help, thanks in advance!

So depression has been a thing all my life, but I only got a diagnosis around 10 years ago (I'm 33). I am also disabled, having a diagnosis of autism and suffering from chronic fatigue. I got therapy, and eventually, medication. The therapy (CBT-like) didn't really help, but at least talking to someone was nice at times I had a good therapist. The medication did help. I was put on 50mg sertraline. 

Fast forward a few years, and I start to do worse. I get sick with bowel pain that appears to be persistent. A few other difficult things in my life happen, and my depression starts coming back. The pain eventually becomes so hindering I have to stop work entirely. I get a pretty intense comprehensive therapy program for dealing with unexplained symptoms, and it is overwhelming. I lapse back into deep depression. The decision is made to up my dose to 100mg sertraline, and I climb out of it. The lessons I learn from therapy eventually help, and helps me control the pain and lessen it somewhat, although the fatigue actually intensifies.

Fast forward to around now, covid times. Turns out, telling someone with a tendency for severe depression ""stay inside and have as little contact as possible"" is a recipe for bad times. I live in a place where I don't have a social network, a result of them moving away and me trying but so far being unable to because disability and dependency on social housing, which is a mess. So events were very important to me, and they've all been canceled now for about a year and a half. I honestly do pretty well for around 10 months (longer than I expected), before things get bad and I seek out my psych again. The decision is made to up my sertraline dose to 150mg, although I note I am seeing a pattern of it stopping working every \~3 years. They don't recommend therapy, as they're not sure what to give me that I haven't had already.

The experiment with the 150mg doesn't go well, the side-effects become really apparent and awful at this dose. We decide to discontinue and try something else. The psych recommends bupropion, but I have another idea in the mean time since I've been reading the promising research on psilocybin (which happens to be legal here). I try that once I am weaned off the sertraline and it works really well... for about 3 months. Then I'm back to slipping into deep depression because it's insufficient. I try the bupropion, but it doesn't agree with me. On day 4 I get a headache and malaise severe enough to knock me out completely for the day, and it feels like the skin on my head is on fire? That last one is extra worrying for me since I really don't want the alopecia that it can cause. I decide since it's actually stopping me from doing social things I have left, I should discontinue.

That's where I am now. The situation is currently pretty bad, I'm struggling to keep the suicidal ideation at bay. I'm not actively under treatment of a psychiatrist at the moment, I would have to look for another referral. Obviously moving to a place where I actually have friends nearby would help, but even if I did find a house somehow, I am in no state to organise and execute a move. I honestly feel pretty bitter about society treats the less fortunate, I've mostly just been left to deal with the consequences of austerity since the financial crash, the failing social housing policy, and the corona policies on top of that.

Since I'm not exactly clearheaded at the moment, I'd like to know what you'd do in my situation. I think I need another medication to try, or stick with bupropion for longer.

Did I destroy my brain and chances to be happy?,"I was on strong antidepressants since I was 15.
I often abused drugs and alcohol.
Back then I remember reading about how dangerous the combination of seratonin boosting stuff like ecstasy and antidepressants can be, but didn't care.
I continued this risky game for about 3 years, when I was 18 and decided on my own I wouldn't need antidepressants anymore and immediately stopped taking them.
I had horrible withdrawal symptoms - irregular heartbeat, almost passing out several times a day, cold sweat, dizziness, I felt like dying... so after a few days I took my meds again because I couldn't take it anymore... I lowered my dose each day until I felt like I could take the withdrawal symptoms.

Now the thing is: I am 21, have a girlfriend, have a fulltime job, but absolutely no joy in life whatsoever. I do absolutely nothing.
I can't even bring myself to do the bare minimum. All I end up doing is swiping through social media and that's it. Every day off.
My girlfriend likes to go out for dinner, the cinema, shopping, or even just go for a walk and so on. 
She's basically dragging me along, I experience no happiness or joy, no matter what she suggests or what we end up doing. There's just... nothing.

We've been together for 1½ years and I can tell she's getting exhausted. I am so sorry for her. She's a wonderful person, I really love her, but she was so unlucky to fall in love with a person who's basically a wall....

Is there any chance I can fix what I fucked up in my youth?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Losing sense of care for self,"TW: self harm.

Hi all, I’m struggling today with a really dark depression that began yesterday evening. I feel like it’s so hard to want to care for myself. As the TW suggests sometimes lately I have been so distressed and yet apathetic for myself that I’ve scratched myself pretty badly. It’s like I just think I might as well destroy myself, because I simply can. I know it’s bad to hurt me and if people see scars I’ll be in even more trouble. So why don’t I care? Do I think I deserve this? How do I care? I’m never going to get better if I do bad stuff like this when I’m feeling low.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Friend committed suicide during quarantine and I feel myself backsliding,"I don’t really have a whole lot to say.  I’ve struggled with depression most of my life.  I was actually starting to really deal with a lot of my problems and was sort of discovering my will to live and fight for myself. I think it’s still there, but it feels like a plane who’s propellers are more often off than on.

In any case, a friend of mine who was living in my old room committed suicide and I’ve been struggling ever since. I don’t feel like I can reach out to my friends because I already exploded on one of them and I think they are wary of me. I can just tell they’re all walking on eggshells and I hate feeling this fragile and out of control. I’ve isolated myself to keep it from happening again.

The thing I didn’t expect is how angry I am. I have been having like violent visions and that’s not really something that’s ever happened to me before. That’s the part that I don’t feel like I can share with anyone. When I look at my anger from a more logical perspective, I know it’s not justified, and yet that’s often not enough to make it go away.

I feel like I’m fighting for my life because of this.  And to be honest one of the things that has kept me from doing anything is knowing how much I’ve been traumatized by this and the fact that I really wouldn’t wish this on anyone else.

I don’t know what I’m looking for, but if there is someone out there who’s dealt with this and can offer me some advice?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
It's not getting better..," Please listen and don't downvote me. I've been facing severe depression and anxiety for about 8 years now. Needless to say, it's been dreadful. I finally sought professional help in the form of psychiatrist. Turns out his meds made things worse. Then after some years, I thankfully found a good psych who did make a difference. The difference is this: I became more 'functioning'. That's it. The inner turmoil is still very much there. I've been to multiple therapists (Mind you, we're talking about the most well renowned and expensive therapists in my region) but it just made no positive change at all. We went at lengths to discuss and dissect me and my life and my behaviors and my emotions. All this 'analysis' increased my overthinking to the point that now my mind constantly thinks and is aware of each and everything. Like 'hey you did this because of xyz feeling'. Its painfully exhausting. It's like a constant 24/7 commentary in my mind, which was fueled by the therapy. After each therapy session, I felt ashamed, guilty, and worthless. So much negativity about me. Reinforcing the idea that there is something gravely 'wrong' with me. Never did I feel validated at therapy. Never was I told what I can do to feel better. It was like talking to a mirror. Just reflecting back what I said. Which quite frankly, I dont need to hear as my mind has been chattering all those things for years now.

I am very lost, confused, hurt and hopeless now. I cannot find any solution.

I don’t know how to help my depressed friend.,"Hello everyone, I’ve come here for help or advice on what to do for one of my good friends. This might be long because there’s a lot to unpack here.

She(19) has dealt with depression ever since middle school. I didn’t know her at that time, only the past couple years and this year has she started opening up to me. She comes from a family that is overly strictly Christian. Both of her parents don’t really believe in mental illness/mental help and her mother constantly gaslights her saying her depression isn’t real and gets told to just ‘suck it up’ or that she doesn’t have anything to be depressed over.

She tells me all the time about how she’s tired, feeling sick constantly, body aches, has zero energy all of the time. It doesn’t help that she works 40h/week. I’ve been pushing seeing a psychiatrist or counselor/therapist, and she wants too, but she also suffers from severe anxiety and absolutely despises the thought of hiding something like that from her parents because even just thinking about it sends her into a anxiety attack of sorts.

Recently though, I feel like it’s gotten worse. What’s even worse is that I’m the only person she talks to about this sort of thing, or I guess the only person she really talks too often in general, but recently she’s started to push me away/distance herself. I don’t know if she means too, or if she’s doing it purposely, but I don’t know what to do. This scares me. I’m trying to be there as much as I can but it’s starting to become difficult. This breaks my heart and I don’t know what to do.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’ll answer any questions best I can.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
Tips for supporting bf,"I really need tips for helping support my bf when he has his bad days. His days come in waves of really highs until one day everything comes crashing down and gets really bad for a few days before turning around and slowly getting better until the cycle repeats.

He says everything bad happens to him and he just feels empty and useless. How do I help show him how special he is and support him without constantly nagging him to seek therapy?

Suicidal Thoughts,"I think about killing myself every week. Every time I do, I feel like I’m inching more and more toward the day I’d actually do it, like I’m on a train speeding toward a cliff and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. I compose the letters I’d leave behind bit by bit in my head.

‘ … Brother, you’re the first-born son our parents should’ve had, and you’ll do a much better job at it than I have. I love you and I’m truly sorry for everything. … Sister, I love you too and I’m sorry for everything. … Dad, I know you only wanted to do good. I know you wanted the best for us. I know you tried. I’m sorry I couldn’t be the son you wanted to have. And I’m sorry for destroying your marriage. Pray for me. … ‘

As to my mother, I couldn’t even begin to think of the words I’d leave behind for her. She deserves more. She deserves more than she ever had.

I know I shouldn’t be feeling this way and thinking like this but I’m a burden, a bug in the matrix and they will all be better off without me. I came to a happy family and I ruined everything.

I feel irrevocably, irreconcilably lost. I don’t fit anywhere, I don’t belong with anyone and wherever I take refuge I’m eventually discovered to be the anomaly I am.

My brain bullies me, my dad lost hope on me and I feel like an injured kid that has fallen into a well and is crying for help.

I’m aware I’m looking for sympathy here and that makes my squirm into myself and want to disappear. Any torch of hope is much appreciated.

Why do I feel so shitty,"Yeah I post here like everyday, I can’t get myself to do any of the things I say I’ll do. :/ I feel like I’ve done everything I could do at this point, so why do I feel so shitty? I feel so tired and “emptyheaded” even though I really need to start on a paper for school. I just can’t make myself get up to do it, I feel like I can’t even start bc I am so weighed down by my own thoughts. I feel ugly, useless and I wish I could just get over that, learn to accept it in the back of my mind as something I can’t change so I could actually do shit. 

I don’t know what else I can do. Going to try to email my dr tomorrow, but I guess I won’t if I don’t get a good start on this paper bc I’m spending so much money on college, literally can’t afford to not do my best or get a shitty grade. I eat healthy everyday, try to lose weight (but of course it’s very slow), but I just feel like I just sit around and rot and I don’t know how to get out of that. 

Thank you for reading or any advice, I really will try to take it but again I just feel like it’s impossible to get myself to do things that aren’t immediately easy.

I don't have any friends,"I feel so unwanted and worthless. 

I'm 19 years old and I am extremely isolated. I live in a depressing, toxic enviroment that I cannot seem to escape from. I think I have learned helplessness. i don't have a job or go to school because my ADHD is literally ruining my fucking life.

My real life friend left me on read. A friend I made from reddit, i ghosted him to see if he'd give a shit about me and i just do maniplative fucked up shit like that and test people to see if they really care about me. Now he doesn't really want to talk to me, i feel it in the texts. 

Everyone around me treats me like i'm trash and an annoyance and i don't blame them. I don't like myself at all. I just feel so worthless because the person i was talking to seemed to be the only one that understood and listened to me and now i don't feel like i'd ever get that support again and i JUST FEEL SO FUCKING ALONE AND HELPLESS. Its like i have to beg and beg for someone to care about me more than i care about myself. My mother cares but she does do some fucked up abusive things at times and make me even more depressed and i'm just lost.

I live with the person who SA me as a child and i have to see his face everyday. My beloved grandmother died before my pedophile of a grandfather last month and i'm just so fucking angry. 

I'm angry that no one cares. Most people won't read this as manpilative as I sound. I'm just so fucking tired.

"Meds helped for a short period of time, but now I have no energy again, and can't do things. Any advice?","Long story short- I was diagnosed a few months ago, but was in denial because I wasn't actually sad about life, suicidal, etc. I started taking SSRI's (Lexapro/Escitalopram) and got a taste of what things could be like. For once, I had all the energy I needed. I didn't spend forever in bed or on the couch deliberating when I wanted to do something, took five minutes to just pull myself up. I no longer felt like I was fighting the weight of my entire body to do simple tasks.

After 2 weeks I decided to drink, and that's when it went downhill. For 9 days, I was without energy, spent hours on the couch watching TV each day, not getting up to do much besides work. I doubled my dose, then for a few days it got better. Energy was back, I was doing things, etc. But then it went back to normal.

To be clear, I'm still not depressed in the classical sense of having negativity about life. I have hope for the future, overall I'm pretty happy with where I am. However, I miss having the energy I had. I miss being able to actually work towards my goals and not feel exhausted by basic chores. My mind would go on autopilot, and I didn't have to constantly make decisions to preserve energy.

Any suggestions on what I should do next? I've been on Lexapro for ~4 weeks, with a small gap last week where I didn't take it for 2 days straight. I'm not sure whether I should seek other meds, keep on my current ones, or even look for other factors when it comes to regaining my energy. I'm goign to book a doctor's appointment and discuss options, but I wanted to know if anyone else had similar issues, and what they've done.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The feeling sucks. It’s almost like this is how older people driven to suicide must feel. A burden on people they know, aimless. Nothing left to live for.

"I’m terrified of thinking I’m giving up, but also I feel like I’m done.","I’m turning 30 next year and I’m the biggest fuck up I know. I’ve been all my life thinking I had a great future ahead as I was a better-than-average student, my parents let me choose the career I wanted (even if it was an economic risk/I’m majoring in arts), went through college very competently, got good grades but I also was inadvertently sabotaging myself. I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, my parents were told I might have a mental disorder such as an anxiety disorder or BPD. I went to a psychiatrist for a whole year but dropped out since I wasn’t feeling any different and decided to instead focus on school. But being honest I never truly made an effort in school. Many professors told me I was talented but I was always so afraid to prove them wrong so I did no major projects. I kept avoiding major job opportunities since I thought those weren’t for me and I wasn’t the right guy for them.

Still jobless, still with my parents, procrastinating, hitting bottom every couple months, with 3 suicide attempts already, and just shitty thoughts every passing hour.

Let's be realistic,"I stand at the gateway between being stuck in my head and living in reality. You could imagine it like an arched doorway, about 12 feet tall. The door itself is made of rocks, placed almost like bars. The support frame is metal, cold, blue. On the inside, behind the door, it's cold, it's empty, it's black. Filled with images if the past, things that I regret, pain, scars. There are two chains on the floor, not far from where I stand. Those chains were what I used to rattle to summon or conjure back the moments I feel I missed. Like opportunities that had passed me by, like love lost by the way side, like all the memories I just can't seem to let go, like all the people I've lost along this road. 

But on the other side there is a light that's beaming bright. I can feel the warmth of the air brush my sides and I feel the urge to come running. Like it's calling out my name, like I no longer need to be ashamed of who I am today, like everything I've ever known has a chance to change.

But my biggest struggle is in letting go. My biggest fear of losing control, yet I just need to find my way home, I don't want to be trapped here forever, inside the cold, growing abyss. Reminiscing all the opportunities I missed. I don't want to die here alone, yet I'm so afraid to move forward, as I navigate this dark night of the soul.

Sometimes it's hard enough just to breathe, as I feel the light taking over me. All the damage hidden underneath brought to life, im forced to see and the well behind my eyes, it opens up, it opens wide. I can feel the tears stuck behind of all the pain I've forced myself to hide.

I feel like I’m merely existing rather than living, and I have no idea how to change it or what fo do to make it better. The only thing that keeps me from ending it is my parents. I could never put them through that.

Anyone ever pulled themselves from the trenches of depression and made it out successfully?

Eating. (Tw),"I can barely eat 2 meals a day anymore. Today I had nothing for breakfast, a cookie for lunch and a few slices of pizza and a few chips for dinner. My family keep putting food infront of me but I always say I'm not hungry. I cant tell I'm loosing weight but apparently my family can. I can't help it. I exercise for hours a day and eat little food. I feel like fainting alot of the time. But I don't want people to find out I haven't been eating so I eat tiny amounts, and then continue on. I drink tea to get me through the day. I'm constantly tired, cold and angry all the time. I don't know what's happening to me. A few months ago I would look at people who said they mentally couldn't eat and say they were stupid, but now I'm the person I called stupid.

I guess it started when I found out I was transgender. I started working out because I hated my body. As time went on, I started to work out more. And as more time went on I started to eat less and less.

Help me. I can't stand it. But I can't stop. No matter how much I want to eat and be healthy. I can't.

"I'm unsure whether I sexually harassed somebody or not, and as a result, I'm extremely depressed.","Hi, guys.

I'm a 23 year-old man with Asperger's Syndrome, and one of the two themes of my pure-'O' OCD over the last two years has been a fear of doing something sexist - this is a manifestation of the moral scrupulosity element of OCD.

For the first time ever last summer, I sent a flirty/provocative text to a woman via the 'Ask' feature on Tumblr, while non-anonymous. The message was an abbreviation followed by a question mark.

I remember the post I found her through specifically saying that she was open to receiving these types of messages, yet my brain is trying to convince me that this is false, and obviously because it's been so long now, I can't remember what her blog is called and have felt a compulsive need to find her, but can't.

I want to die, because I don't want to live with the shame and guilt associated with having potentially sexually harassed somebody, but I'm so very certain that she was soliciting these messages, as well as answering similar messages from men on her blog and being receptive to them. This is what my recollection was last September when I first reflected on it.

I wasn't trying to be strange at all, I was trying to be more confident than I had usually been in this circumstance.

Please, help me.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

I think about all the things that I have done in the past, I have talked to many people about them but the pain is just as deep as before. I have decided to stop talking about the stuff cause I can tell that everyone around me is getting bogged down by it and people are more happy when I pretend to be.

 I am going on trip to the place where all my pain started to hopefully overcome it all and to turn my life around from the pain. I don't know if it will work or not. any tips on what else I can try?

Also I get depressed because I have dreams where I'm constantly bombarded by women who are not my wife who want to have relationships with me and it's a nightly battle to not give in to it when I'm dreaming.

Prescribed lamictal for depression?,"Hi everyone. Apologies for how long this may be. Has anyone been prescribed lamictal for depression WITHOUT having bipolar disorder, along with suffering from low testosterone? A bit of b/s - my SO was prescribed lamictal to combat his depression (which is also very likely triggered by low T, which we are in the process of trying to treat), and tapered up from 25 mg to 100 mg within a month beginning in June. Prior to starting it, his previous most recent depressive episode was back in December. After he tapered up to 100, within a week, he immediately had a major severe depressive episode and never came out of it. Rather than his normal highs, high level mediums, and mid levels, he bordered on depression the entire time. He began to withdraw completely throughout the entire month of July, and then hit a second major depressive episode that lasted about 2 weeks. Throughout this entire time, he began saying he no longer wanted to be here, doesn’t have feelings for me anymore, etc. I urged him to stop taking the lamictal, and although he has reached out to his psych multiple times over the past few weeks, he has yet to hear back so he decided to stop on his own. Since stopping the meds a week ago, I’ve seen flashes of the man he used to be coming back - but unfortunately, the medication numbed him to the point where he simply just doesn’t want to be here anymore.  We’re not exactly sure what to expect from this point on - he keeps hoping that the longer hes off, that he’ll come back to what he was feeling emotionally but at this point we just don’t know. We’re still awaiting the results from other testing, but for now, we’re just circling the drain and it’s legitimately killing me.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Loving one is Depressed :/," 

Hey guys,

so i was ""daiting"" with a girl and after trying and trying she couldnt get any feelings for me.

We got into a big conversation about it after 2 months. She never told anybody and never ever talked about it with somebody. She told me that she is Depressed. I asked for some reasons and when it started. She told me that it started in high school because her parents have really high hopes in her and pressuring her pretty much. She is 19 now. I feel like (she told me as well) the reason why she can't love me is because of her depression. I told her that im ready to help her anytime and all. But she doesnt want help and really doesnt like it when others help her. She doesnt cry infront of anyone because thats a symbole of weakness she tells me. I really care about her. It even feels like it hurts me more then her to a point. I dont know what to do. And i feel like if i will be there for her that one day she might feel how it is to love somebody. Since she told me that she never loved someone really. So if anyone could give me a tip on how to handle the situation that would be the greatest thing ever.

I also asked her this question on a scale to 0-10 if 0 is: that she loves her life and most things are going well and 10 is: i want to kill myself as soon as possible. She answered 8. I'm really concerned. And getting a therapist isn't an option as well for her. She would never take any pills either or so. She isnt Religious, she feels the ""best"" if she is just alone and if she has her quietness. She feels pressured if she is outside with her friends etc.. She also doesn't find relationships appealing. Maybe because she never had a good/real one with feelings but that is just an assumption. She has guilty feelings because she started daiting me and wishes me to find a better one. She doesnt really like herself etc etc. Dont understand me wrong. Outside she is a extrovert, like nobody would know that she is actually depressed im sure. She acts like a woman that is really happy with most things. But some sings i could read told me how she things about certain themes..

Please i beg you guys please help me to find a way to help her. Thats the only thing that would make me happy. I would give everything for her to slowly feel ""normal"" again. I want to be her saviour/hero :(..

I'm a fat useless slob and not god damn thing fucking works.,"Long time  friend  from college is manic, unstable, and abrasive.  Trying to address issues from a long time ago when my father was an emotionally abusive duchebag, mother was sheltered and never worked or had to do a god damn thing herself till her 50's. My brother was physically abusive cunt.

Both Bro and Father were almost always drunk, or high as fuck on pot. In my youth We had I think it was 3 TVs. 2 for the family, 1 bro got from somehow probably dumpster diving.  My father would use all 3 for his precous fucking sports shit. He'd have a completetantrum if he missed a play or some ""super important"" second of a fucking god damn play. Mother and him would have fights. SHe'd always leave notes threating to leave. I think I tried to uncously devise ways to not be home much because of that shit.   

Grandpa was just an asshole. I loved him, don't me wrong, but the motherfucker was a distant asshole. His wife spent most of her time shitfaced. I don't know how we managed to keep it together for enjoyable dinners that were legit great. 

Bro would come home drunk and start beating or kicking me ""to get the fag out of you and make you a man"". HIs fucked up girfriends got off on that.

I tried to stay in my room because my parents were to fucking pussy to say anything to him . THey called it  ""No Karate in the kitchen"" looking back that's not cute.

I was bullied to tears, had my fucking shit stolen on the regular from jealous cunts from a ghetto. I hated everything  about jr high....wait loved the nice girls i met.

Brought home one of my girlfriends. A super soft, gentle, kind nice,, just mmmmm yummy girl I met in some class IIRC. Think name was jen. We came over to my house to study. since I wasn't getting help at home for shit on math. She somehow got me through a class inn Jr. High was about to flunk. Had tutors, dreaded going that meant a car ride with one of my family aholes.

Sufficed to say Jen introduced her self to grandma. who pretended to be polite. I over heard her a little latter asking mom ""why he \[ie \] me with some kinda' nig\*\*\*\* "" . :( that so hurt. I loved jen for being friendly cute, and we had things in common, she was cute AF, and we played video games (when my dad wasn't having a meltdown) 

These days now I'm just good for being fat, broke, broken and useless.  ICAN'T EVEN FIX MY MY OWN FUCKING COMPUTER!!

I hate how my buddy from college calls up at 8 or 9 in the evening ""you old man shit why you in bed"". Or has hissyfit about a Bluetooth head set sound like talking though a can. but the the bitch calls while she's  ""multitasking"" and has 99zillion fucking zoomb calls going!

I fucking hate how a SSD drive on my god damn computer died then when I need just  few bucks to help  cover the cost of a regular ol hard drive I'm read the riot act.

and I'm tired of the entire shit show of the world right now, my fucking life is a useless shit show. and I . I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THE FUCK. WHAT THE FUCK ELSE AM I FUCKING SUPPOSED TO DO!!

No pixels were harmed in the creation of this piece.

&amp;#x200B;

None of the characters are at risk of suicide or self harm.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Situation Report or some other random sub heading or another.**

&amp;#x200B;

As some of your know, every single morning, 7 days a week / 365 days a year, my first thought upon awakening is that I wish I was dead.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes that is an exaggeration. There have been four days in the past two years that weren't like that. Perhaps tomorrow will be another one, but probably not.

&amp;#x200B;

Today (Tuesday) is especially hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, I was told to that today I might get a particular piece of good news.

&amp;#x200B;

The barrier of these tidings is putting it at 50:50.

&amp;#x200B;

He is known to be overly optimistic.

&amp;#x200B;

I am putting it at 90:10 against and the odds are really probably much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

But the magnitude of the news would be life changing.

&amp;#x200B;

In a few hours I will probably feel let down. Despondent. Angry.

&amp;#x200B;

For a week I have been avoiding unpleasant tasks that, if the goods turns out to be real, I won't have to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

So in a few hours they will be back on my list.

Advice/Help,"Hi there!

So I decided to create a new Reddit account to write this.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit - but thought I'd want to just talk about things.

I have been dealing with anxiety for around 3 years now, and have been experiencing depressive symptoms for around a month. 

I don't want it to sound like I'm complaining - but I just feel exhausted. I'm tired of always trying to be better, to improve and hoping that things will change. I had seen different psychologists over those 3 years, and although one had worked really well for me - the rest felt like I was just talking about my problems without actually coming up with a solution.

Honestly, it feels a little bit surreal for me to even be writing a post - because I've tended to lurk reddit for so long and just read things.

I know people say that things will get better, and yes - there is COVID/lockdown. I just become so angry with myself that I'm not improving at the rate that I really want to be. And I honestly don't even know where to start to initiate that improvement.

I guess I just really want help.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tired,"I’m tired of having no one. Im tired of feeling like no one cares even though they say they do or “understand.” I have literally like no one it sucks. Like you’d think I’d be able to find a good friend or anything near that. I have no family basically. At this point I’m way beyond lost hope. Tired of the way things work to as soon as something good comes along it ends fast. Nothing even helps me tried doing everything in the book. I’ve got treatment resistant depression so literally if a med helps which they usually don’t they help for a month and then stop working. My doctor won’t even reply, listen, or even send a text back for a refill on anything. The world is just pathetic. Like it’s so hard to find anyone that’s really genuine. I’ve always disappointed my parents with almost everything. My older brothers the golden child, and I get treated so different.

Why can’t I quit MY job because of health problems?,"I love my spouse. Truly, 100%. She’s the only thing that keeps me going most of the time.

But I’m still stuck at my shitty job, and it’s negatively affecting my mental and physical health. Back in February, she quit her job because her anxiety and agoraphobia got so bad that she couldn’t go in to work. She just stopped going and told her boss that it was health related. She was unemployed for a few months while she searched for something else and I was the only wage-earner during that period. My car broke down, we lost our storage unit, I struggled to make rent, etc. She’s working again and making more money doing something that’s better for her health and I’m so happy for her.

But I’m losing it. I’m slipping. I’m angry all of the time. Physically, I’m in a lot of pain. My wrist hurts every time I move it. My back aches. My knee which I injured last year has never had a chance to heal properly because I’m always working. Mentally, I’m struggling. I can’t keep going on like this. I need to quit my job.

But when I say that, my spouse just says, “I’ll help you apply for jobs. I’ll help you write a cover letter.” My mother says I shouldn’t quit without a job lined up. But my spouse quit her job without having something lined up. Why am *I* not allowed to quit? And if I mention maybe going back to work with kids again, my spouse freaks out because she doesn’t want me working with kids because of the pandemic. I just want out of this job!

I’m scared he’ll leave if he finds out the truth about me,"Long story short but I’m talking to this guy I met on Tinder and we talk a lot. I met him once and we got along great. We went out for dinner and we talked for a long time about music which we’re both really passionate about.

He lives a long way from me so we haven’t met up since, but we talk on Snapchat and IG all the time and we’ve talked about him coming to visit in my new apartment, and I wanna come visit him where he lives.

TW: Talk about SH

However, I’ve been self harming since I was in middle school, and I have a lot of scars on my upper arms and my hips. A lot of them are still pink, and some still have scabs on them. We haven’t really talked about deep personal stuff yet, and I’m scared he’ll stop talking to me if he finds out. 

I’ve also been terrified of people finding out for the past 10 years, and for that reason I’ve never been intimate with anyone. 

If he does come visit, which I really want him to don’t get me wrong, I’m worried things will go farther and that he’ll find out not only that I’m still a virgin, but also that I have all these scars on my body. 

I don’t wanna be too forward about it, and none of my friends or family knows about my SH so it’s not something I’m comfortable talking about. 

I wanted to talk to my psych about it but she’s sick so she cancelled my appointment today and I don’t know when I’ll get a new one. 

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can deal with the situation? I want him to be prepared so he can choose for himself whether or not he’s comfortable with taking things further with me, but I’m also scared I’ll scare him off and I have no idea what I should even say to bring it up. I don’t even know if he wants anything more than a friendship although I suspect it, so I don’t wanna assume things that haven’t even crossed his mind.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
What else can I do?,"I just turned 36 and feel like my life has passed me by. Relationships are non-existent in my life, life in general has just gotten progressively worse. 

I don't know what else to do at this point. This has been a 16 year journey to find freedom from depression with no distinguishable positive results, unfortunately - not even a little bit. I've followed through to completion with ketamine infusions, 10+ different medications for depression/anxiety/adhd, neurofeedback (biofeedback) treatments, I've seen 8 different therapists, a handful of psychiatrists, life coaches, psychoanalysts. I've taken psychedelics. Occasionally with a new drug or treatment, I break free momentarily - I feel infinitely less burdened - I feel hope - this usually only lasts a day or at the very, very most a few days... I always, always fall back to where I was again. 

I force myself out of sheer will to exercise and eat healthy every day, that definitely helps - without that, I would be so much more miserable. But the fog is still there. the self-defeating thoughts still there - nothing is ever good enough. I still feel so stuck, unmotivated, and deprived of life. 

I heard of TMS Therapy - I spent the last of my savings on the ketamine infusions so I can't afford them right now, even with insurance. I'm terrified it will only work for a bit of time, then I'll have thrown away thousands of more dollars in the process.

I am not a quitter.. I have no desire to end my life. I just don't know what is left to do to feel joy in my life, to break free from this once and for all. Is there hope here?

I need help,"I'm going to open up and be honest just because I'm at a breaking point. This is a breakup story that has been like non before. 

I (M27) was dating a beautiful girl (F24) on and off for three years. We met in college where we dated for a year before we separated the first time. In that first year she had to have surgery to remove a bone spur on her foot and put on some weight. Personally that doesn't bother me. I've never cared for my ladies weight, I'm more into the personality, but it mattered to her as I saw her put herself in a bout of depression, harsh judgements to herself, and ultimately was just very unhappy all the time. I did all I could, telling her not to worry about it, cooking healthier meals, telling her she's just not as active. And eventually after 6 months of recovery we started to go back to the gym but she was never the same so. And after having to remind her everyday, every conversation that everything would be ok to no aval, I broke up with her. (I regret this decision). I made this decision because I too, to some degree am self conscious and at the time I took it as a response to me. I thought she was unhappy with me.

We ended up trying again a short 4 months later but it too was short lived. Same result, every conversation we'd have, she'd talk about her weight, and I could see in her face how unhappy she was. This was also a bad time in her family as her mother just got breast cancer. So she went back home. On the way home (AL -&gt; KY) her car broke down and without hesitation I drove the 4 hours to meet up with her to fix her car and drove back because I still loved her. During this time covid began and any shot of seeing her was gone. I just started a 6 month coding boot camp where my days we're pretty much planned from 8am-8pm Monday - Saturday. We had talked about how I could be a developer, working from anywhere and I could be with her and she was a marine biologist, so her work was dependant on location so I was okay with going wherever she needed to be. (While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives).

After I graduated bootcamp I moved to Washington State, to gain some world experience and she did the same thing, but interning in the Caribbean as a marine biology instructor. I started at this time having extremely unhealthy night terrors. I was still madly in love with her, I had a ring in mind from our first relationship and one night was exceedingly bad. The next morning I told myself that I would reach out to her, tell her the truth of what I was feeling. So I did. I told her about how much I missed her, my night terrors, why we separated and my insecurities about how she was feeling at the time. And I told her that I still loved her and either needed her in my life or I had to completely cut her out because my mental health was really bad. These night terrors are demons like no other. I hop no one has to be afraid to sleep because they may experience watching and hearing their ex get railed by guy after guy. It truly is a haunting experience.

After I reached out she told me she had missed me, and felt the same. We talked about what thing's would be different and how we would be able to go on from there. She had 2 months left in her internship before she came back to the states. During this time we talked about the future, where she wanted to work, when we could see each other again, things we could do etc etc... The reason it was difficult is because I landed a job as a software developer in idaho that only pays 52/yr. So plane tickets from Kentucky aren't the cheapest. I also got us a hotel room and tickets to see one of our favorite bands tame impala. Well. When the day finally came where she returned to the states something happened. She did a complete 180 and told me she no longer wanted a relationship and wanted to be independent to travel the world and teach Marine biology. I was always supportive of this idea but the way she described it to me seemed that instead of a partner, I was more of an obstacle. And she eventually ended the relationship.

I was hurt, really really bad. I was sad, and angry, I felt like I was used and treated like what we had was nothing. And everything we talked about leading up to her return was all a joke. But now I'm left with nothing but night terrors. Every night I go to sleep, after drinking and smoking a large amount to try and numb my senses before I doze off. And last night was the first night the night terrors returned. I could hear vividly my ex getting railed by some imaginary ghost figure of my dreams. My heart bleeds and I'm at a point mentally where I can feel myself slowly changing as a result of seeing these terrors over and over again. 

I don't know what to do. I can't make it stop. I have 1 friend that I've told and I can't tell my family. I wish all of this came out differently. I wish I was a stronger man and was able to stick it out with her during that time. I wish I could've married this girl of my dreams and built a life together. But now I'm left with the fact that she is going to be seeing someone else and I'm here in idaho, having night terrors, about the one that got away.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

Maybe I should just go and die. God damn I can never say anything to you without you getting upset and hurt!""

I have a son. Even though I have no job, he goes to a babysitter. I only watch him twice a week. I love him and I miss him when he’s gone but I can barely even take care of him when he’s home. I know he’s going to grow up to resent me. I wish I was the same person that gave birth to him but I am completely different. He’s such a good kid. He’s so happy I wish I could be a good mom for him. I wish I could be who my family needs me to be. I hate myself. I am terrible for my family. Most of the time I think that staying around is going to be worse for my family than if I just left. I don’t know what to do. I want to be happy but I’ve tried so many times to heal and the attempts have never gained any happiness.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

How do I get myself out of a rut/slump? How do I stop self-punishing myself?,"It seems I have been in a rut/slump for five years and I don't know how to get myself out of it.  I seem to be subconciously self-punishing myself for everything that I view as a flaw.  I don't know what hobbies I could do,  It really frustrates me that I don't know what makes me happy anymore. 

I feel that my sister doesn't truly support me in my  gender transistioning even though she keeps saying she does.  It seems like her and I just have different love languages (Hers is gift giving and mines is words of affirmation) , and so it makes me feel like her vibe is inconsistent and that frustrates me even more. 

I have been constantly feeling terrible about myself and others, but I primarily take it out on myself because I don't want to hurt other people with my emotions.   

I am very tired of feeling like I don't like myself and I want to care about myself...but I don't really know how.  

My parents basically told me that I evolved backwords, I was a very happy kid that could do quite a lot when I was a child,  but now as an adult I hesitate,  I close down,  I feel like  a shell of my former self.

Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships.,"I guess I'll tell you a bit about myself, since this really is a chance for me to rant.  I know the question sounds edgy, or attention seeking but I just can't get this thought out of my head.


Okay so I had a shitty childhood as lots of people had, mother was Schizophrenic, father was controlling and abusive.  It created a lot of stress for me as, I never got a chance to build friendships as a child.  I was too scared to bring people home and have them see what my family was like.  Also I was usually way poorer than the others in my area, so I would constantly be judged for what I had or how I'd dress.  Though thats not what's causing me stress now, I've somewhat moved past that phase.

My family became somewhat middle class, I live with my stepmom and dad in a new city when I was 13.  He isnt as bad anymore, but I hate living in this city.  As soon as I came here, I got bullied and pushed around.  Had to deal with being jumped and just insecurity.  Shortly before moving I started to find my group, and I had friends that I had a lot of fun with, even though most of the time was spent at their place, but after moving I couldn't find anyone I vibed with.  No one I can connect, everyone thought I was weird and out of place.  So I just focused on myself - I want to be a computer scientist someday do just focus on that.  Though there was always this sense of loneliness.  I am socially anxious, awkward, and have trouble meeting new people, but honestly on the inside, I am an extrovert.  I constantly crave social interaction, I want go spend most of my time with other people, like the only time I need alone time is to practice piano.  But even then its more fun with others around.

This loneliness just slowly made me sadder and sadder.  I slowly got more and more awkward and struggled more and more to reach out.  Once highschool started, I did make a small group, but it was honestly super toxic so I had to break free.  I couldnt deal with the constant threats and judgement.  I left hating myself though and feeling out of place and like a loser.  This went on for a while where I had one friend.  Untill the end of grade 11, I got to this point where I thought maybe I should just end it, and that was just what I thought every moment.  I was so close to doing it but these couple girls in my class started reaching out to me and pulling me along.  I didn't tell them anything of course but they would just joke around with me and one of them was super flirty though I didn't read it at the time.  I started to get to this happy high in my life, then I met a girl on a bus who sorta signaled for me to talk to her.

We ended up dating for almost 2 years.

Now one of the girls I met in class, I'll call her Angela, is a friend to this day.  Throughout grade 12 we spent everyday together, we would always be togrther at lunch, or between classes.  I met a lot of friends through her though, some of them I didnt vibe the best with.  A lot of them were suspicious that we were dating, and her guy friends got jealous of me.  So they started telling her I wasn't trustable and its sort of weird that we are so close even though I have girlfriend.  But, I just vibed better with girls I found.  She would rant to me, I would joke around with her, it was a fun friendship.  We didn't text at all though so once we weren't able to spend so much time together it got complicated.  I'll get back to Angela later.

My ex, the girl I dated from april grade 11, to december 2019, the end of my first semester of university.  I'll call her Kayla.  I have actually blocked of so much of my memory of her, like I remember maybe 3 or 4 moments over a year and 8 months or so of dating.  We started of pretty good, but I believe we were both immature and didn't know how to set boundaries or handle a relationship.  Which is what led to a lot of fighting.  I do remember we fought a bit around a year into the relationship because she kept cancelling plans with me to go out and play games.  Like I never tried to get in the way of her friendships, but she cancelled our anniversary date, and just a few other dates we set up literally the evening before or the morning of to hang out with friends.  I told her that I wanted her to hang out with friends but the constant cancelling plans with me and not trying to reschedule was hurtful.  Ahh, a lot of it is coming back now.  I would honestly say we were a bit codependent, she relied on me for emotional support as her mother was extremely controlling, I relied on her for my social needs.  Not a healthy relationship.  We ended up breaking up after growing a bit distant, and at the end she played a bunch of games with me.  Her mother didn't want me dating her which was the main reason we broke up.  So she told me if I can convince her mom, shed let me get back with her.  I didnt do this of course but I was distraught.  I felt like I had nothing.

I started playing piano in grade 11 but quit while we dated because of the effort it took.  Most of my time went towards school and her.  I ignored a lot of my friendships more than I should have during the relationship so I was in a terrible spot.  It made me realize how unhealthy a person I was.  I had struggles reaching out to the 3 friends or so I had because I always questioned whether they liked me.  But when we broke up, they were there for me.  Though I hated myself for opening up to them, showing the weak side of myself, showing my insecurity, and once again depending on others for emotional stability is so unhealthy and unattractive.  

I cried infront of them, I told them about how I suffered with suicidal thoughts, I told them about my past and what I went through and they listened to me.  I am grateful for that but I never should of told them a thing.  2020 happened and I began isolating myself, I attempted suicide once at the start.  I tried reaching out to Angela, I didn't want to tell any of them about my issues any more but I wanted to distract myself and have someone to chat to.  No response, the lack of effort I put in my friends finally came to haunt me.  Once I got over my ex in march 2020, no one wanted to talk to me anymore.  We weren't able to see eachother at school and I didn't build that relationship where we can just text.  We weren't able to hangout so the friendships sort of rotted.  I thought I was hopeless, friendless, and losing more prospects for the future.  I dont have connections to be successful.  I have nothing.  So I though why not end it.


I took a bunch of pills but I just ended up blacking out and puking a bunch.  I remember the feeling of blacking out but I could still hear the voice of people freaking out as I was fading.  I lost vision and feeling but I could still hear.  I thought I was dead.  But no I wasn't, I started therapy regularly.  I was so hopeless and didnt know how to make friends but I kept pushing through.  I tried reaching out a few times and sometimes they said hi back.  I ended up hanging out with Angela once restrictions lifted a bit in the summer.  But after that we struggled to talk again.  My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that.  

At the start of 2020 after the breakup, I started getting into philosophy actually and began focusing on including stoicism and other ways of being into my life.  Just accepting that things go wrong but thats okay.  Its very hard and I obviously have yet to achieve it but I wanted to learn to be happy even if I didn't have everything I want.  I began journaling what I did and didnt like about myself and tried to become a better person.

This awkard phase went on for a while, I would talk to my cousin for comfort.  We would call and game, though honestly, I lost interests in games.  I started craving to play the piano again and by 2021 I decided to get back into it.  I practice a lot and can play a couple chopin pieces, but I still am not very good so its not something I can like show off to people.  Also I became incredibly more awkward, in trying to better myself, I became super apologetic and passive.  I struggle to joke around because I don't want to offend, or I just feel awkward.  I never know what to say, and I am always trying to think like is this what a good person does.  

Which inches closer to today.  I struggle so hard with making friends, I don't have much interesting skills.  I don't have much hobbies besides piano, business, and like history.  I am not super funny.  I am awkwrd and uncomfortable with new people.  I am needy.  I am dependent on social interaction yet I get none.  I am not as good looking as I once was.  I feel so unattractive.  Like why would anyone want to be friends with me, and no matter how hard I try to get out there or be interesting, it seems I am always the one putting all of the effort to relationships.  I am the one chasing, and no one is giving me any thought.

I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april.  Its a ldr though, and her timezone is 14 hours ahead.  It was pure infatuation at the start, we both felt so confident about the relationship.  She had plans to move to the same city as me, we had so much in common.  We were both sort of shy and laid back.  Though as I got more comfortable my extroverted side came out.  I think I smoothered her too much though, I always complimented her and tried to tell her it'll be okay and I am eilling to wait for borders to lift to meet her.  She liked it so I kept doing it, but I think the repetitiveness, lack of physical touch, and my neediness eventually became unattractive.  It became the norm. I was always there for her when she needed to talk, and we kept talking about how we are going to meet as soon as borders go up.  It was hard to keep interesting and we didnt know what else to do.  Then in the last month, things started getting hard for me at work and in my family, I opened up about insecurities about my mom health as she was diagnosed with cancer, and how I feel I have to work on my confidence.  I think this must have really been a turn off.  She has become more and more distant this past month.  She still says shes into me but she doesn't talk about the future as much and is not nearly as affectionate as before.  She has said she doesn't know how much longer she can do ldr, but shes willing to keep trying a little longer for me.  But it feels like she isn't putting any effort and idk, the relationship doesnt feel secure and loving anymore.  I talked to her about it and she said she really likes me, but she feels so distant.  Idk what I can do to help this or if theres anything.  I really like her, like we never fought, and we really matched.  I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her.  Not feeling uptight in this relationship like the last.  But yet it still feels like its coming to an end soon and I can't believe this is happening again.  I really want it to work but idk what to do.  I tried reaching out to friends more and making new friends but its more of me putting sll the effort.  No one is responsive.  Like I don't need to talk about my girlfriend or the relationship, I just want to distract myself and have people there so I feel cared for.  I am stuck in this spot I was in, in 2020 again.  I am about to be alone again.

I of course have not told my girlfriend about these thoughts, not her problem.  But like I feel like my life is going to be this cycle of me craving attention and chasing others away.  I cant live in this constant cycle.  Love isn't worth it, if it always ends in a break up.  I have no close friends so I am going to be alone.  Like am I just bound to suffer.  I don't even think I enjoy cs anymore, but it feels too late to go into music or business.  Plus I don't have the contacts for business.  My career feels hopeless, my relationships feel hopeless, and being more confident one day feels like a longshot.

So here I am thinking to myself, do I end it? 

Is it worth the continual suffering?

Is this relationship hopeless?

Will I find friends that I can connect with?

Will I become a better person?

Will I succeed?

I don't know, and at this point, it feels like I should give up.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
What actions do you take to feel better?," 

Hey there. I'm putting together things to try to make it easier to take positive actions to deal with depression and anxiety.

I've dealt with anxiety for most of my life and I'm 8 years sober from drugs and alcohol. But I'd love to get others’ perspectives on the actions they take to when they are feeling, well, down. Clearly I don’t have all the answers.

I'm new here but there are some really thoughtful posts on here so I want to ask:  What are some actions you take when you are feeling depressed?  How do you get yourself to take actions even when you'd rather procrastinate or lie in bed?

Everything is a Blur,"Hey guys, i've been suffering a lot recently regarding depression and anxiety to be honest. I just wake up feeling awful, and my days are a blur, hell i can't remember what i was doing like 5 minutes ago.It genuinely feels like i've got alzheimer's at times. I just feel like all the joy has been sucked out of everything as usual.

Everything blends together, my depression and anxiety are collaborating each other on their next big project: Make me feel as miserable as possible! (shitty idea for a youtube series/album, right?).

It's either, feeling utterly miserable, useless and guilty with low energy and nothing to even look forward to during the day even though i should. Plus, i feel like i've lived a thousand years already and i'm just beginning to hate the world if i'm honest with how people are. 

Or it's my health anxiety + Regular 'ol plain anxiety, with panic attacks, thinking i'm dying constantly even when i'm not having a panic attack. Whether or not it's one of the two is all up to the wheel of misfortune that i spin most days, sometimes to keep things fresh and exciting it can be both at the same time!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, i'm looking for some support or some advice on what to do. I'm currently on a waiting list for therapy, and i'm just looking for something to help in the meantime!

I don’t know what to do,"I (19) have been severely depressed for about 6 years (undiagnosed). At around the same time my depression started, I was pulled out of public school by my mom so she could “homeschool” me.

Depression has fucked up my brain so bad I fear it is damaged beyond repair. I’m not living anymore.

I might be able to transfer to a 4-year school but I don’t know who will be willing to accept me since i never took the ACT or SAT.

Help with Husband's Depression,"My husband and I dearly love each other and he's going through a rough time right now. He's really depressed and I feel like there isn't much more I can do to help him. He seems fine at work (we work at the same place) but as soon as I ask for help around the house, his entire demeanor shifts. He used to always be so willing to help me and going out of his way to do so. Now he won't even sort his own clothes. It's been really hard for us. I'm working almost two full time jobs and then I come home to do all of the cooking and the cleaning. When my husband comes home, he goes straight to videogames and will play them for hours.

My husband won't seek out therapy and I've convinced him to go to the doctor to have his meds looked at.  I've tried talking with him many times to see what's wrong and he just says ""I don't know."" 

What can I do to help him?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
How to shut off that negative inner voice?,"I have a voice that has been getting louder recently and even more reactive. I think it was always there but after being more self aware during my abusive relationship I’ve been able to hear it better. It goes

“I’m so ugly”
“I suck”
“I’m so lazy”
“I’m going to get fired”
“No one likes me”
“I’m a loser”
“I’m broken”
“There’s something wrong with me” 

And it’s automatic. All the fucking time and it will literally say this as a reaction to 110 things. Yes I think I have some self esteem issues, I had some control issues (bulimia and orthorexia), high anxiety, codependency and some problems choosing healthy relationships for myself.

24yo disabled female wants to reset my life,"I’ve recently come to the conclusion that no matter what I do with my life; it doesn’t improve or move anywhere.

I’m 24yo, confined to an electric wheelchair from a condition that no one can tell me if I will degenerate from or not, I’ve never been in a serious relationship and every dating experience I’ve had has ended in disaster and heartbreak that’s taken me months to get over. 

I’m a writer, but never seem to be able to get a job in it, no matter how much I apply for. My recent job in a TV company has ended, so I have nothing to do with my time anymore.

I only have two friends who I don’t feel close to anymore. They both live busy, fulfilling lives with their significant others and don’t remember have time to hang out anymore.

My mom is quite controlling and still treats me like a child, so I’ve been unable to get my own Carer to have some independence.

My sisters are both in relationships and make me feel depressed with their fulfilling lives, yet my mom doesn’t believe me when I say I need therapy and will only pay for my sister to see a therapist.

I feel like my life is going nowhere as it’s got progressively worse over the past five years, and due to my disability I’m unable to easily self harm in a way which would get me help.

Antidepressants,"Antidepressants

Hi!

I’ve been thinking to take antidepressants for a while now. I have sudden outbursts (or breakdown episodes (?)) wherein I just cry and cry. I can feel the physical pain in my chest, or heart, specifically. It’s so heavy. I’ve been seeing a psychotherapist for a few months already, but it doesn’t seem to help. It started because of work which I already resigned from 2 months ago. And then this pandora’s box (collection of traumatic events in my subconscious) seem to have been opened so I’ve been still experiencing the breakdowns despite seeing a psychologist.

For people who took antidepressants: Was it worth it? How was your experience with it? Did it help? 

Im sorry I just needed answers. I have no friends who took antidepressants before. Im also shy to reach to them, especially now that I need them the most. 

Thank you, strangers.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Suicide bereavement making existing depression intolerable,"Obvious TW for suicide

My depression is worse than ever since my little sister died by suicide last year. Like beyond normal grief, it worried my suicide bereavement counselor type stuff.

I can't post on the suicide bereavement sub because my grief makes me suicidal and I don't want to trigger anyone over there. When I posted on suicidewatch everyone ignored me and I got embarrassed and took the post down after like 6 hours.

I just feel so depressed and don't want to be here right now. I'm doing my best to stick around for my family but it's hard. 

I'm not excited about my career, my relationship, my prospects for ever living a good life. I just want to sleep until my next therapy appointment on Monday  and then sleep until the one after that and soforth. 

I don't believe my life is ever going to get better and I'm just so done. Last time I tried the hotline I couldn't get through to anyone and I wasn't an active threat so I'd probably get triaged out anyways. What do I do?

Advice coming off meds,"Hi, just wanting some advice. Over the past year I developed pretty significant anxiety and depression, and after a while, my friends at uni noticed and advised that I seek professional help. I was then prescribed antidepressants (sertraline), which I've been taking for the past few months.

Things overall improved over the summer, but about a week ago I decided to stop taking them, as I don't feel very comfortable being reliant on medication, and I feel like my life is at a significantly better point now.

I recognise that this was probably the wrong call, and if things get worse again I will get back on them.

However, since coming off them, I've been experiencing almost constant headaches and dizziness, to the point where I am sometimes unable to walk, meaning it's difficult leaving the house, or meeting up with anybody, as I feel like I can't maintain the required amount of energy. This means my lifestyle has reverted to what it was like at the worst points of the last year, being unable to go outside, and feeling unable to talk to anybody on any medium.

My father always wanted me to get a good education, and wanted me to have a good life, but I don't know how to. I don't even know what the problem is, which is why I can't fix it and I really just can't take it anymore. I want to go home, and I want all of these bad feelings to stop.

What HAS been working?,"What are your favorite tips and tricks for making depression a little easier to deal with? I realize no one thing is going to fix everything, and if it did you probably wouldn't be on this sub anymore.

Am engaged in an all out war against depression, suicidal thoughts, and grief. Please don't report my post, I'm staying safe and already have the hotline numbers preprogrammed into my office.

Some of the things I'm already doing: therapy, grief group, medication, art, talking to a friend, trying to be regular about exercise, regular sleep, eating decently.

Things I'm not willing to do: drugs. I also can't really afford to go back to intensive outpatient/partial hospitalization.

Things I've failed to use successfully in the past and would need additional support to figure out how to integrate in my life: any kind of mindfulness practice or yoga type shit. Religion/spirituality also hasn't really worked for me historically.

Found out my ex moved and is dating again,"It's been a whole year since we had last talked and I didn't even mean to find out. I was talking to a mutual friend of ours and I asked how she was doing without thinking.

The news hit me like a truck, it felt like all the work I put in to slowly stitch my heart back together was for nothing. A week ago I was going about my life, happier than I had been in a long time. Now I can't even concentrate without thinking about her, about what her life has become without me.

Does this qualify as depression?,"Recently a pattern in my behavior has become very clear to me. Whenever I don't have a structure in my schedule to keep me busy, out of the house, and socializing, I begin to fall apart.

My hygiene suffers, I sometimes go a week without showering or brushing my teeth. The amount of dry shampoo I use is scary. 

I always end up binging, with food and television. I was doing great all summer with a healthy diet, exercising, losing weight. Then my summer job ended. Now I spend the majority of my time watching show after show and mindlessly eating while I do it.

Whenever im alone in the house and not distracting myself with food, tv, or porn I just end up pacing around, staring out the window melancholically like a antidepressant tv ad.

I've had a therapy consultation at my college where we primarily discussed my potentially having ADHD and my struggles with feeling guilty about my academic underperformance. I might've gotten to talking about whether I'm depressed, but I never actually had a session, they were booked until the end of the year.

I'm just looking for some answers, thinking about trying to find a therapist, but the only local source has had many questionable testimonials.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Every night just before drifting off to sleep, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of self hate and guilt.","I'm a seasoned pro in dealing with depression but this is getting out of hand. It used to happen every once in a while, but now it's consistent every night. 

As I lay here with my eyes closed and I begin to dream, suddenly I realize I'm a horrible employee and I'm on the verge of losing my job. Or I'm a horrible father and my son deserves better. Or I'm a horrible husband who should have let someone better marry my wife and make her happy. Or I suddenly realize my finances are messed up for someone my age. Or I feel like I'm the worst kind of friend. The tremendous feeling of guilt is absolutely overwhelming and I wake up and have to often times sit up, my heart pounding like crazy. The house is a mess, I've been working on the same task too long at work and they're going to find out I'm a fraud, I have a ton of yard work I need to do and the neighbors think I'm a total slob, my son doesn't feel loved and needs better things in life. The list expands exponentially if I let it, even as I type it out it's flowing in like a river of crippling worry, my face is completely bloodshot like I'm  embarrassed, and I can't catch my breath. 

All I want to do is go on facebook and tell everyone how sorry I am for being so embarrassing. Or go sit at my desk and work more so I have more to report on in the standup. Or go lay with my 4 year old son and tell him how proud of him I am and how great his Lego creation tonight was. Or clean and organize the whole house so my wife wakes up and feels good about being married to me. I get this frantic feeling like it all needs to happen, but its too late, the day is over, and I messed up again. 

I did not feel this way an hour ago when I laid down in my bed. It spikes in me just before drifting off to sleep, like I was watching my life in a movie but then I suddenly realize it's real and I am overcome with fear, dread, embarrassment, and guilt, like I'm driving a train off a bridge or something. Could it be a brain tumor pressing against some part that controls these negative ""flight"" reactions? Why am I feeling these things flood into my brain right before drifting to sleep?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Sometimes the worst part isn't what happened to us but being alone with the pain from what happened to us,"I've had a crisis today from a breakdown/tantrum in front of my parents and it's late into the night that my friends who would've normally supported me are asleep and also all crisis phone or text lines are especially understaffed around this time.

I don't use suicide hotlines or access &amp; crisis phone lines or text lines anymore all those things that my former therapists recommend because of how many times I've felt worse afterwards or been hung up on dealing with someone who's already numbed and burned out themselves. I get it, the mental healthcare system is understaffed and underfunded and the therapists I've had, it's just been so disappointing and regressive to my health. 

It's just like the classic conditioning example: if you shock a mouse enough times everytime it tries to eat food, it'll be too afraid to eat even when the threat is long gone.

Rarely are people seeking for advice and answers, most times people just want to be seen and heard and feel supported. 

I got angry at my mom for sharing some news with my brother on the phone, which was something she was talking highly of me for but nonetheless I felt very angry because I despise my brothers for how much they've ruined my life and I had a tantrum in front of my parents because I was reminded of the last time my brother rubbed it in my face of my depression and financial situation when we fought and despite my mom giving him good news of mine he'll probably use that to mock me with when I'm back to a poorer financial situation again.

I'm hurt and angry and also guilty that I got angry at my mom who was just trying to talk highly of me but I very much want nothing to do with my brothers. I've had a terrible relationship with my negligent parents all my life and I'm fortunate that they actually feel guilty and sorry about all that and have been genuinely trying to help me now. I spent some money on something helpful for my mom that she very much uses and loves because I'm grateful for her help which was what she was talking about and after getting angry at her but expressing it in an unhealthy way I feel like shit.

It doesn't feel the same trying to vent online, because I want my female friends that I know and care about and feel a genuine connection with to make me feel heard and listened to, and always starting from zero talking to strangers and trying to provide context about who I am and the dexterity of my mental illness is exhausting. I'm a very supportive and helpful person to my said friends when it comes to mental health problems, and having to be on the receiving end and in need of help at inconvenient times just sucks.

In the past I've posted to reddit and people will look at my post history saying ""you are a very mentally ill person and should get help."" And I wish I could just say that ""most of us mentally ill people don't have to luxury to afford anything that actually can help."" And we'll have to take what little opportunities we can get even if it's not ideal or in the least helpful. Lonely people don't have the luxury to choose who can comfort them.

Any other depressed mental health professionals out there?,"I’m wondering if there’s anyone here who can relate... I am on my doctoral internship which, is my last step towards getting my doctorate in clinical psychology.  I had to move 1000 miles to start my internship which is obviously stressful because I’m away from everything familiar and my support system. And it’s stressful because I’m stepping into new role working 40  hours a week as a professional, rather than being a student and working part time.

 And my anxiety has affected my work. And the more my supervisors have provided what was intended to be constructive criticism the more I have felt like a worthless piece of s. And the more I’ve messed up, the worse their criticism has gotten. And now my supervisors want to meet with me next week. Pretty sure I’m going to be put into some kind of remediation. Or fired. And I feel like such a worthless failure I don’t think I can make it through this year. And I can’t help but think that my life is over, and I should just be done with this.  

My 8+ years of education in psychology and hundreds of hours of therapy have not helped me get away from the feeling that I am worthless as a human being. I know where it comes from, but that doesn’t solve things. I can’t use cognitive restructuring to think myself out of how I am feeling. I have tried and I’ve tried and I don’t know if I can do it anymore. Sometimes I think I’m going to be OK, I think I can pull myself out of this.

I'm currently out of state for college (we are freshmen) and he's staying home with our parents. His GF contacted me recently and said she's worried that his depression is getting worse. He doesn't tend to talk to me about it so I believe her.

Thing is he has access to a psychiatrist but he says ""they can't help because I don't tell them anything"" and doesn't really answer why he doesn't actually talk to them. (We suspect he has anxiety too but that hadnt come to anything yet) His school offers free therapy (which I've taken advantage of at my own school) but he doesn't take it, nor thinks he needs it.

I'm extremely afraid im going to lose him and his gf and I don't know what to do. We've talked about getting him committed but we aren't sure how or if that would actually help since he's already isolated (he hasn't made friend at his new school yet) 

Does anyone have advice??? Please help, I don't know what to do.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
"I need help, TW SuçI∂e","Well Hello to all the people reading this.

so I'm going to have to be careful with the information I disclose, as my situation is precarious to say the least.

So I've made some mistakes, I hurt some people in ways that aren't bad but I had to make it clear that I am not an angel, nor am I the devil. When I hurt those people, a lot of people, people who really don't like me but have nothing to do with this started finding ways to ruin my life. I was accused of leaking a 14 year olds nudes, raping someone, lying about my age, and sending my nudes to people who didn't want it (the reality they asked). Some guy accused me on his story publicly and since he has a ton of followers and people on his side so people immediately took his side of the story, without ever taking a deeper look.

I've gotten my own nudes leaked to almost everyone in this city, outside the country, friends relatives family. The pics and vids were sent to my parents as evidence and then my cousins and extended family. A tiktok was posted with my nudes in it and in like 3 hours it had more than 80K views, and by the time it had got taken down it had reached 380K views, and was then shared privately between the hundreds of thousands of people who saved it. Everywhere. In addition, I've gotten death threats, people trying to find where I live and where I go to school. I've lost every single one of my friends, not one has remained. I feel so lost and confused. Some part of me feels like I'm the bad guy and this is ""the consequence of my own actions"", I mean I wasn't always 100% clear with my intentions. But then on the other hand there's people who are playing this just like a game. All they want to do is ruin me and since they have no direct evidence for their claims so instead they ruin my life. 

I can't feel safe anywhere, and hearing and reading what people are saying about me, about my nudes, about my private conversations with people just makes me hate life even more. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed, not of my actions as much as the fact that the whole word had to find out about it. 

I know you're thinking, this kid is in school, still a teenager and probably just overthinking it, but I literally can't go to the city center without fearing for my own life. I live in one of the biggest cities in the world, I've lived here since forever and  I know how big it is. I didn't think it would get this far, but it has. There is not one person I know that doesn't know about this. I can't have any friends here because everyone judges me and no one can ever see me for who I am, they even found ways to get to my friends abroad. I have no-where to go, and no method of escaping the thoughts I get. 

I get mad at the world and I want to take revenge for all the people that hurt me but then I realize I could never possibly do that so then I feel powerless, just like how I felt all those other times when IT happened to me. So then I get mad at myself, and I make myself believe it was all my fault, and this leads to a cycle of self harm which very quickly develops into a fine line between life and death. 

Thank You for reading.

Any replies will be very much appreciated.

Feels like I’m brain dead,"
Hey,

I was a rather intelligent individual due to the fact that I was able to achieve an IQ of 140 on the Mensa test. From the grades I got in high school I also got admitted to Cs and engineering at a good university and that’s what I’ve been studying now for about 3 weeks.

But for months, I’ve been feeling that my brain function and my mental reasoning ability has decreased drastically. I am now struggling with math problems that I used to ace in high school, and I have a hard time learning and especially remembering things even though I study a lot. This is taking a toll on me! My memory has worsen significantly to the point that I need to write things down in order to remember it. I even need to search up simple words because I have either forgotten what the word actually was, how to spell it or the meaning of the word. And this happens every single day. 

My depression comes in waves and when it was really fucking bad (couple months ago) I was going insane. It has now calmed down a bit and I have absolutely no clue if my symptoms are caused by my depression or if there is a hidden underlying condition that I don’t know about.

I'm lost in life,"Hey Reddit, so I'm looking for some kind of advice here. I'm 18 y.o right now, and I don't know what to do in my life. Right now I'm studying in university for some kind of IT and security and I absolutly hate it. For the 5 days I haven't understood a single world. So yeah, I'm stupid(not judging just by the university, I've always been like this, just sitting and don't understanding shit), also I got almost no social skills, I don't really like people(just kinda avoid them), I'm not talented at anything, I'm not skilled at anything and I don't like anything. Everything I do I hate, really hate. So yeah, right now I'm in some kind of situation, where I don't really know what to do next. University is too hard for me, and I think I will drop out aftwr first exams because I'm too stupid too understand this and hate this too much to force myself to study. I asked my friend about all this things and he told me some stuff like: ""yo go find yrself"", or ""yo, just do things"". But it sounds stupid for me. I'm so f@cking tired of trying something, and then after investing time finding out that you suck at it, and also you suck at many many other thing aswell. I realise all those thing like that I need to try, because else I will never know, I need to talk to people e.t.c but I can't force myself to do it. Also I never had a girlfriend, and I don't think I ever will have one, because I'm too uninteresting and unattractive to date me or even talk to me. I don't really look after myself  because at this point I don't really care. And probably if I fail my exams at my university I'll just commit suicide, because I don't see a point in living anymore, I just need some kind of trigger to help me make that decision. If you give me some advice it will be very good for me right now.

Depression that's caused/exacerbated by my job?,"Does anyone have any advice for dealing with/managing depression that's either caused by or exacerbated by their job?   


My job closed back at the start of the pandemic. I was off work for almost a year and a half. Things were actually starting to look up the last few weeks/months. I was slowly becoming productive again. Getting closer ot feeling normal. I was actually making progress on my portfolio and studying, to get a job that I don't hate.

But my job opened up again last week. It's been 3 days. And already, it feels as though I've spiralled all the way back down to exactly where I was before. It feels as though this horrible dark cloud is hanging over me again.

I feel permantently exhausted. Too tired and on edge to get on with anything. Everything just feels like this big, anxious bad dream, slowly counting down to when I'm next working. I just feel a constant dread, waiting for the next shift.

I hate my job. I hate the people I work with. I hate my customers.

I don't know how to stop feeling like this. But I *need* to if I ever want to get out of this job. I need to be focused. I need to be able to focus on getting this portfolio done. I need to focus on picking up these qualifications that I need. I need to be able to focus on studying. I'd almost got it down during the pandemic.

Help Changing for the Better,"I've suffered silently with depression and anxiety for most of my life, usually covering it up with relationships or alcohol. Long story short, my depression and anxiety stems largely from childhood and teenage bullying and growing up in a home with very unhappy parents who weren't meant to be parents. It wasn't until recently, on the verge of divorce, that I've moved past the stigma of depression and admitted that I suffer from it. I've been taking high doses of CBD and l-theanine daily (I've seen the unintended, scary side effects of prescribed antidepressents too often in former friends), in addition to daily meditation, getting outdoors daily for at least 30 mins, daily exercise and changing to a healthier, mediterranean diet. All of this had helped tremendously, but I still have occasional bad days like today where it's a struggle to start my day.

Due to my ongoing depression and anxiety, I haven't used my brain the way it is supposed to be used, and as a result, I am very slow at thinking and making decisions in the heat of the moment. This has caused nothing but pain for me in romantic relationships and with roommates. I feel so incredibly stupid. I desperately need to change, and I have been trying, but it hasn't been easy. Every time I say this week is going to be different, it isn't. I get into constant arguments with my roommate because of my slow thinking and ingrained selfishness. 

I am reaching out for advice from anyone who has been where I've been and made it through. How did you finally change for the better? I'm at my wit's end. I really want to change, I really do. My roommate says I can't because I just don't care enough. But I do care. I just can't figure out for once and for all how to improve myself 10x more (e.g., my memory, my intelligence, my selfishness, being more aware of my surroundings, and most importantly, truly living life).

When I go through these depressive episodes I tend to procrastinate a lot, I don't have the energy to clean my house or do my work. And this is obviously making me have consequences at my job, I'm scared I'm gonna get fired, all of this is just making me feel worse. So I started seeing a therapist who has been helping a lot, but she told me it was normal to relapse and that recovery is not linear, I started working better and I cleaned everything. My routine went back to normal for a couple of weeks, but  since two days ago I'm going through another depressive episode, and  again, I don't have the energy to do **anything**, I haven't been able to work at all.

What can I do about this? Do you have any advice for me?

I  don't mind mentally relapsing and feeling sad, I can deal with that,  but I need to keep my life going and keep my routines intact or at least functional.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Is it possible to date when you're depressed?,"It feels really impossible to even attempt to find a partner when you're depressed. Dating apps are a pain and most of my matches I get either unmatch instantly, are scammers trying to get my money, or girls trying to get subscribers to their onlyfans (which I'm not against OF I just don't think a dating app is the best place to look for subs). Which makes me feel extremely ugly and only worth anything when I can give money to people. With dating you kinda have to sell yourself, but I can't. I hate myself and I don't see myself as attractive at all.

I’m a filthy person. I just throw my stuff around without even thinking it and by the time i notice it I feel too overwhelmed to clean. 

Another thing I struggle with is my dental hygiene. I keep forgetting to brush my teeth, and when I do remember I dread it and try to avoid it. I know it’s kinda childish but I hate the taste of toothpaste and struggle with focusing on it, even though it only takes two minutes.

Need a good book for my depressed teen and I to work through together,"My 13 year old has been sad/depressed/overly stressed for a long time now. Recently he has shared that he has started to have moments of invasive suicidal feelings. We developed a code word for him to let me know when he feels that way and he likes me to sit with him at those times but I know we need more help. He doesn't want to go back to counseling even with a different counselor and we have talked to his Dr who wants him to try using some strategies/coping/life changes. 
He is kinda willing to go through a book with me and asks why he should go to a counselor because he can talk to me, doesn't know a counselor well enough to trust them, his past counselor didn't help, and in general dismisses all my answers that include they are professionals, counseling has helped me, counselors can be trusted, we can interview a couple different therapists, science backs counseling etc. 
Help me find a not cheesey workbook, toolkit book, etc for us to go through. Ideally one that would be good for a teen. He's not super on board with improving sleep, etc so if a book gives good logic he'd be more open to it than me or his Dr suggesting it. 
We are liberal science embracing Christians so open to books with or without a Christian perspective but science based is must.

Am I experiencing bad anxiety?,"So I (26F) have suffered with depression since I was about 14. I had a bit of anxiety maybe when I was around 16 but I never remember it feeling like this.
I work 12hr night shifts and I know that probably doesn’t help with my low mood but just lately I have been really struggling. I’ll lay down to try and rest and my heart will race, so I have to sit up and breathe a few times, my chest gets tight with it sometimes too.

I feel so lonely rn I feel like no one cares and sometimes I want to endit.  I just want to be held by someone and told it okay. I just want to be loved and I feel like I’m not good enough. All I want to do is cry and lay in bed. But I can’t shake this feeling my heart is literally throbbing as if I feels how sad I am. My own mother doesn’t even like hugging me. She gets annoyed every time I ask for hugs and hug her. She always says “you know I love you I just don’t like being touched” that’s genuinely hurts me. Because I love her and she says she loves me but it makes me feel like she doesn’t. My love language is physical touch and words of affirmation and I get neither of those.

Time for meds?,"Hi. Question if anyone could help me. I’m considering finding a dr and asking for this drug. BUT. I always thought that anti-depressants or for people that were depressed for no real reason. It was simply a chemical in balance and no matter what was going on in their life good or bad they were depressed. That’s not me. But in the last 18 months, my mom has been diagnosed with dementia and majorly spiraled and there’s a lot of insane sadness and anger and abuse that comes with that, my stepmom was diagnosed with colon cancer has had two major surgeries and is on her second round of chemo, my dad is of course a nervous wreck and he’s already a hypochondriac overweight. The pandemic closed down my entire industry and career and I had to move cities back home to help my sick family so I have no friends here and no employment in the career that I’ve been extremely successful in for the last 30 years. I finally found a boyfriend that I really loved and thought everything was going well, but we had two miscarriages and it went downhill really fast and we wound up breaking up a few days ago. My 16 year old furbaby is dying and the boyfriend took “our” dog. I also lost a couple of jobs that I really wanted and I really could go on and on about the nonstop bad things that of happened. I am able to get up in the morning and function and go to my few little jobs and hang out with my family and take care of them. But I am extraordinarily sad I cry multiple times a day. I had my 40th birthday this year and I’m terrified I’ll be alone and childless forever. I had a prescription for Valium and I have some left so I have been taking one of those in the morning and it may be helps a tiny bit. Anyway I guess I’m wondering if I take an SSRI if it will make any difference if I don’t really have a chemical in balance I’m just currently having a really shitty life and none of those things are gonna change anytime soon. I did start talking to a therapist on an app but I’m not sure I like it and may have to find one in person soon. Anyway. Should I take an SSRI? I’m scared of side effects. I’m scared of fertility issues. I’m scared of weight gain. I’m scared it won’t work since I have REASONS to be depressed.

My family wants to give my cat away because they think he's contributing to making my brother sick. I can't deal with losing my cat, he's so important to me. Along with my brother being sick, I can't leave my house in case I catch covid and give it to him, he'll die. And I can't move anywhere else

I very apprehensively got into a relationship with a friend of mine, but since then, he's stopped being fun and nice to me. He keeps on running away and coming back, and being cold to me, and it all hurts, but I'm too weak to leave because losing a friend entirely hurts more. I wish I'd never gotten into this.

What to say to someone who talks about killing themselves and having depression?,"TW: mentioned suicide wish.   
So I am not friends with this person, but I have followed them on social media for a very long time (4 years) and have met them one time in person, when we were close in vicinity (they live in a different country). We also wrote sometimes via dms about this and that.   
About 20h ago they posted a checklist for signs to look out for, if you suspect someone is going to take their life and they made a check behind nearly all of them. In the caption they talked how they want to die, how they feel like a failure and absolutely worthless with what they archieved (or not archieved) in life so far.

"""Paying for happiness"" - anyone else?","Some quick background: I have struggled with anxiety and depression for much of my adult life (I am 43). For many years it was low-level and manageable, with occasional flare-ups, but an extremely traumatic event three years ago triggered a period of major depression in my life that I am still dealing with. I am very high-functioning - most of the people in my life probably wouldn't even know of my struggles if I wasn't very candid about them - but it can get really, really bad sometimes. 

I have gone to therapy for over 15 years now and for the past few years have regularly seen multiple therapists. I was on various SSRIs/SNRIs over the years but they never did much of anything for me and I have been off all meds for about 14 months now. I did GeneSight pharmacogenomic testing recently and it turns out that I have significantly reduced folic acid conversion (which is apparently a common characteristic of people with major depression) and so I started taking folinic acid supplements a little over a month ago to try to help with this. No noticeable improvement yet.

I have also been doing psychedelic-assisted therapy for about a year now, which includes weekly talk therapy with a strong focus on processing childhood traumas, reintegration, IFS (internal family structures) therapy, and the like. As part of this therapy, I have done 5 ""journeys"" so far. This has been the therapeutic regimen that I have felt the most growth and progress from, but I am still plagued with lots of issues. 

I really feel like I'm throwing everything but the kitchen sink at my depression (plus stuff like meditation, exercise, sometimes yoga, etc. etc.) but nothing every really ""takes.""

I have noticed a pattern recently where when I am able to experience true happiness (which is fairly uncommon for me - not just feeling pretty okay but genuinely feeling joy, having actual fun, etc.), I will inevitably experience a comedown within 1-3 days. And the better I feel, the harder the comedown is. It is like getting high on a euphoria-producing drug and then having the inevitable crash. It is as if my body and mind HAVE to revert back to a depressive norm, like a rubber band snapping back; the higher I stray from it, the more intense the snapback. This is devastating, even as I have recognized the pattern and come to expect it. It literally feels like I am punished by my own body/mind for daring to experience happiness or joy. It feels like a cruel trick by the Universe every time, or like I have to pay the piper for not feeling depressed for one damn day.

I have considered the possibility of bipolar disorder, but I really don't think that's it. Certainly yo-yoing between joy and depression has that weird polarity, but the happiness is always caused by externals - a trip somewhere, quality time with friends, a great experience, etc. It doesn't just come out of nowhere. I really have to find and create the happiness. It is the ""punishment"" that has no rhyme or reason aside from following the pattern. It is inevitable even if nothing bad happens to bring me down - it's just a crash, like a plane running out of fuel and dropping out of the sky. And while the happiness can feel euphoric sometimes, it doesn't feel like any kind of manic episode I've heard or read about. It is more just the joy of feeling some goddamn unvarnished happiness for a little while. 

Does anyone else experience this?

"Is 31 yo too late to treat more than a decade of depression, find friends, and fall in love?","
I'm your middle aged loser stereotype:

* 31 years old
* unemployed and living at home
* personality &amp; interests gone from a life of depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder

But I have this horrible, haunting fear that being in my 30s makes it too late to make any meaningful connections with anybody anymore.

I have zero interests, zero hobbies, and no personality. 31 yo seems too late to start building those things and connect with anybody. I hear even normal, level headed people struggle to make new friends and date in their 30s.

"I’m lost, stuck and desperate","I’m at a point in my life where I am extremely depressed and have strongly considered suicide. I always feel weak and tired, with no motivation or willpower to do the simplest of tasks. I feel like any motivation I have to better myself is weaker than my will to end my life.

I live in a moderately poor house (we have the money to put food on the table and pay bills, but the slightest slip and we’re homeless), I’m 20 and dependent on my parents, my dad who is also depressed and unhappy with his job, my mom is chronically ill and bedridden for the most part.

Heavy Shame From Drunken Past,"Starting around 2015, I tried to fix my depression with alcohol. Stupid, I know. I'm sober and I think quite a lovely person now, but I can't stop remembering back then, and feeling this all consuming shame that makes me want to die. 

First instance, I was nervous about/at a social gathering. I drank too much and don't remember everything, but I think I spoke to a poor, nice guy about Shakespeare and my dream of being a writer and god knows what for ages, and then I was just obnoxious. Not my shy self anymore. Talked loud. Tried to high five somebody who left me hanging because, well, you couldn't blame them. Just awful cringy. I did a semi burp, I think, which alerted my friends, who got me into the bathroom, and then I remember being half asleep in a chair, with that lovely guy trying to reassure me that I would be getting home soon. My mum eventually came and got me. I threw up in a bin outside, and was spouting Yeats poetry whilst stumbling with my mum and my friend holding me up. I can't stop remembering, and feeling this suicidal, heavy shame. 

Then, 2017, I met my boyfriend. Gorgeous human being. For maybe three out of the four years we've been together, I've been a sporadic drunk. Drinking at home. Getting drunk. Crying my eyes out. Or angrily breaking up with him, self-sabotaging. He's had to take the locks off all the doors so I don't do something stupid and he can't get in. One night, I even blanked out. I don't drink like that anymore, but I cannot stop thinking about how horrible it would've all been for him. I was so needy, horrible, greedy, drunk, and delusional. 

And no matter how much I apologise and try to make up for it, I still feel rotten. He keeps telling me to forget about it, not linger in that place, and that he's forgiven me, but how can he? He's been this amazing guy, and I was unemployed for about two years there, along with the drunk crap, and broke up with him and then felt shame and apologised in the morning way, way too many times over. 

I'm aware that I'm just living far too much in the past, but I can't get over this shame. I need help.

"Excessive drinking, help please","Hello guys.

A friend of mine has always been quite introvert. Preferably staying at home to read a book. He hated alcohol, partying and smoking. And he used to be very socially awkward.

Since he became depressed, he started drinking and partying a lot. He also gets drunk quite often, sometimes this will make him scared and I would have to go get him. This isn’t the person he used to be. And I know alcohol is bad for his Multiple Sclerosis and Depression. (He is using antidepressants). But he doesn’t seem to care. I don’t recognize him when he behaves like that..

All the while he keeps ignoring people’s texts because he doesn’t have the energy to respond. But apperently he does have te energy to party? Which is something i do not understand.

I will have a talk with him tomorrow. 

What can I do or say to support him? How do I make him realize that his behavior is selfdestructive without making things worse?

What could be his reason to drink so much alcohol? I really want to understand this huge change in personality, but I keep thinking that depression isn’t an excuse for it.

I have a caring primary care doctor and a psychiatrist — they want to help me manage the intense levels of panic and depression I’ve recently experienced while using minimal medication. I’ve been on mirtazipine (an antidepressant) for 4 weeks and I’m able to function more (reduced depression but ongoing anxiety). I am also trying to eat more and gain weight as I am underweight.

*“Issues”—*

Nightmares (resulting insomnia), panic attacks that last 2-6 hours, flashbacks, hyper vigilance, dissociation, physical pain, anxiety, depression. I also experience a lot of self doubt and self blame. No history of hallucinations, drug misuse, or violence towards others.

All of the above have improved significantly while being on mirtazipine. I am now able to sleep regularly and eat well when before I was neither able to sleep nor eat due to the level of panic symptoms I was experiencing. Mere improvements in sleep have allowed me to better manage anxiety and panic when they do happen.

*My goals —*

I want help with regulating sleep, food, and mood so I am more equipped to manage triggers and painful memories, while also creating a future worth moving towards. My body’s responses are natural responses to an unnatural situation of abuse. I want to be able to listen to my body and give myself what I need, which is tenderness, kindness, and respect. I expect respect and gentleness from people I interact with as well - it is essential for my healing. I’m not interested in picking apart my trauma or suppressing what is showing up - I want to be able to meet my needs fully.

*Things I’ve tried —*

Medication, therapy, meditation, healthy food, exercise, self care, and trauma informed movement. I’ve found that mind body integration through somatic work + low dose medication is an amazing combo. Talk therapy has felt highly distressing lately (maybe because my providers are not actually trauma informed) even though I’ve been engaged with different types of talk therapy for the last 8 years and had success.

**I feel hurt by my intensive program —**

I started an outpatient intensive partial program (in addition to monthly check ins with my pcp + psychiatrist) and I think it’s doing more harm than good. *This is where I need your thoughts.*

1- The intake staff raised their voice at me but I hoped it’s just the cruel gatekeepers and that the actual staff will be kind because it’s supposed to be trauma informed.

2- I got thrown into a 6 hour day when they told me it will only be a quick 20 minute intake. It instead turned into 6 hours of invasive questioning, classes, and therapy - during which I was required to be present and not eat.

2.1- There was no personal check in or regard for the fact that I was highly disregulated because I wasn’t allowed to move or eat when hungry. This resulted in a 5 hour panic attack after the day ended, nightmares, and inability to sleep. I struggled with severe body aches for 2 days after because of how distressed I was.

3- Part of the program day was meeting with a psychiatrist that immediately fixated on racially targeted questions - “where are you actually from” “why are you here” “what’s your visa status” even though I never brought that up and she assumed I’m foreign because I’m not white. This meeting lasted 13 minutes after which she told me my current medication is incorrect and I need to be on antipsychotics (?) without ever asking me what I need. She interrupted me every time I tried to express what is currently going on. She barely looked at me and spent the whole time eating and looking at the computer. This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program - everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires.

4- I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me.

5- almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation.

6- I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I don’t feel respected.

7- The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public — the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation.

8- The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example — a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name “vacation spots” that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician (an intern in training) had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group.

9- The program is apparently owned by a for-profit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedIn+Glassdoor by staff.

Everyone ghosting after some time,"Hey, eh, life is shit. Whenever it goes good, in next few days sth shit happens.
Now I dont want to even have good moments, because after them there are 2x more worse.
Last few months I lost my job, ended weirdest relationship ever which I still miss, suspicion of stomach cancer. Everything at 21y old. Besides that my parents literally hate me and only few friends stayed with me, rest faded out because I wasnt going to drink vodka/alcohol almost everyday.
And the worst part of last months/years are new peoole who I meet.
Most of them were really cool, always said they will never ghost but after some time they were doing same shit, which fucking hurts when you get to know someone close.
Now I feel like fucking shit, being on knees in front of toilet, vomiting blood, not having energy to go out, when few months ago I wanted to start marathon.
Only positive side of last months is reducing amount of drugs( throwing cigs, max few beers per month etc). And also withdrawing from being addicted to halcion. Now I'm also really scared about university, because there wont be online lessons, but normal.
And in current state its hard to go up from bed, not talking about living as normal student.
Nothing on Earth basically makes me happy now, Im just living because Im too scared to end this? So I just let the life pass. But I will probably not live much longer naturally so.
Even my psychologist postponed my visit over 2 weeks in currently worst part of my life.
And my ""real friends"" are banter type so I cant talk with them about these topics(yes i tried ended bad)
I just want soneone to idk ask me whats up in my life, talk with me and say everything will be ok.
But it happens only in 2 situations:someone need money or is sexually attracted shortterm.

Scared to call crisis services,"I'm in the USA. I have no insurance and effectively no money (like, none; I have some family, but asking them is out of the question). I'm pretty sure something's pretty wrong, considering I've been crying and panicking and bludgeoning myself and thinking about suicide for years now, but I don't have any resources to go to an actual doctor.

Earlier tonight when I was more worked up I called the US national suicide prevention hotline. The guy I talked to gave me the number for mobile crisis services in my (rural) county. I explained my financial/insurance situation to him and he assured me that if I call them, a doctor with this service will come to my location and it's free, no charge…

…but even if it's true, what then?

I can't imagine they're going to actually do anything except take me to a hospital, stick me there for a few days, maybe they give me some medication… and then they release me and tell me to make a follow up appointment with a doctor somewhere I can't pay and probably can't physically get to (no car, rural area), and I get a bill for the hospital stay. Which I categorically will not be able to pay. If that's what would happen, I truly am better off dead.

I could really do with some kind words.,"So I just got off the phone with my GP. She's prescribing me Prozac. I've never been on psych meds before.

I'm 17 and have struggled with increasingly worse severe depression since I was 11. I'm undiagnosed as of now because I'm only this last 2 months seeking help for the first time (kind of a do-or-die situation.)

I'm from the UK and NHS mental health services are dire. My GP essentially told me that due to being 17 and a half years old, I'm too young for adult mental health services and too old to be referred to the adolescent services. She listened to me talk and on the spot said that I sound like I have PTSD (I honestly feel like I do as well, but  I'm not prepared to say I have it w/o formal diagnosis) which I feel was way too quickly to say something like that.

Basically the next half year i'll be monitored to make sure the Prozac doesn't finish me off, because in people of my age it can make suicidal feelings get worse.

I feel so lost. She said I can't see a psychiatrist or a clinic or anything until I'm 18, which is 7 months away, so I'm just put on meds and stuck waiting.

I feel such lack of support or urgency... I literally want to die and they're just like ""here's some pills, come back when you're 18.""

I don't know, maybe I'm complaining too much. I just felt like they were worryingly quick to give me meds and tick me off the list. I'm super overwhelmed right now, there wasn't even any talk of side affects or really what to expect, apart from ""by the way, these pills make you even more suicidal sometimes.""","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
I have no one else to talk to,"Well, here goes...

I'm 30 years old and work as a systems administrator for a tech company. I work long hours-- 10-13 a day, specifically, and I don't have much to show for it. 

Not without showing appreciation for what I have; I can pay my rent for the tiny, but cozy apartment we live in, the lights are on and there's food on the table, but it's so, so very hard to maintain that. I'm not complaining or blaming anyone, but I'm the only person in my house that has the ability to work. But after the last couple years, even I'm starting to struggle. 

I have borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder with psychosomatic symptoms. I willingly starve myself when I feel fat and ugly. I'm on five different types of medication, all of which cost nearly $100 for me to get. My partner is also dependent on medication. We're both ill, but their situation is a bit tougher than my own. We can't afford to see the doctor often, no matter how hard i work. I make decent pay, but because of our crippling debt and the growing housing crisis, I have to work 50-60hrs a week just do we have enough money left to get groceries. 

I feel like a failure. I come from a wealthy family that has all but abandoned me. I have my mother still, who is as supportive as she can be, but even she struggles to help me when I'm at my worst. 

Up until recently, I used to allow myself to succumb to my feelings and share them often. But all that did was cause those I spoke to to worry about me. They're understandably frustrated because simply talking doesn't always help me. There's so much stress and anxiety in my mind that I'm constantly in pain and telling my loved ones that either scares them or leaves them speechless. 

My partner told me they feel helpless when they see me this way, cried while saying that too. My mom told me the same. So... I decided to wear a false smile and tell them I'm okay so I don't make them feel that way anymore. Its not fair to spread my pain to others. Their problems are so much bigger than mine. I usually snag the bathroom for extended periods of time because its the only place I can cry in private. So... I spend a lot of time in the bathroom.


I feel like a failure all the time. I couldn't give my partner a house or a honeymoon. I can't afford to get her the treatment she needs and I certainly don't consider getting any for myself because I feel like I can still function on the bare minimum. I can't work two jobs like I used to because my physical health has started taking a nosedive. 

I know that things could be so much worse for us. Its not like I'm ungrateful but I just feel so bad all the time. I'm constantly feeling like everyone hates me and sees me as a burden. I feel like I have nothing to show for all the work I do and I can't stop working because we can't afford it. I'm lucky to be working from home for now but we return to the office soon. Now being around people in a small room terrifies me because of covid. If I get sick, everything will fall apart for my family. 

I'm so, so very tired. And in mental agony. All the fucking time. I can't afford therapy, i don't even know where to start in finding outside support. Not even sure why I'm posting here... I just needed someone to know this. Its not like I want to kill myself or anything, I have too many people depending on me, but sometimes I wish I could go to bed and just not wake up. 

Everything hurts. All the time. And I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place or if this is an eyesore on this subreddit.

How do you love yourself when you don't see any value there?,"Hey all. I’m turning to you because... I’m not sure where else to go.

I’m living in Melbourne, Australia at the moment. Getting help is tougher than I ever imagined. Mental health organisations are overworked and understaffed. Therapy sessions are far from affordable. And I am holding on to my last string. To be honest, I have been for some time.

My whole life, I’ve felt undesirable and worthless. I don’t see much value in myself or what I do, and I never have. I constantly feel like a waste of space. It has me thinking: is life really worth living this way?

I met someone who made me feel otherwise... at least for a while. But the honeymoon phase is long over and as he retreats back into his shell of commitment-less comfort, I melt into a puddle of misery.

Perhaps it’s because I know the one thing I’m unequivocally good at is **loving someone else**.

One of my closest friends recently sat me down to commit to improving my depression, which I get. Things were okay. 4 days later he told me we talk too much, but everything is okay. When I asked why the sudden shift in communication. Often my friend would be the one to initiate the conversation, call me first or text me first. It was mutual. We both texted random crap throughout the day.

I need help….,"I’m really struggling today.    My normal coping techniques (getting outside, watching a favorite show, etc) aren’t working.    

Weekends are always tough for me.   But it’s now October and my late Mom’s birthday is in two weeks.   I was her caregiver.   She would’ve been 65.  Qualifying for Medicare and we could’ve gotten so much more help for her paraplegia.    And since she was a teacher (i.e. state worker) she didn’t qualify for disability or other help.  

Thanks for nothing for her 25 years of service huh?    Regardless, it’s bothering me more as this is the year her life would’ve gotten easier (and mine) and she’s not here to enjoy that.  I would’ve been helping her with her new paperwork, enjoying the research, etc.  

Add on to that, I took a new job in April, and while good, it’s a big change. I then lost my dog (which was Mom’s as well) in June so I’m now alone.  I’m single as my caregiving responsibilities didn’t give me a lot of dating time or opportunity.  

Nothing much excites me anymore.   My music has fallen to the wayside.   I can’t enjoy playing a video game.   

And trying to lose weight (for health) during all this is just added stress.  

Ive never been a quitter, pretty ambitious guy.   Not anymore.  It took a year to get past my Moms death.   But now losing our dog is like losing her all over again.   Add in pandemic stress on that and there you have it.  

I’ve had some really dark times here as of late.

This is too long and no one likes reading long shit but I just can’t take it anymore idk what to do,"Today I woke up to the sound of my neighbours bellow me screaming, arguing and slamming shit. It’s been happening more often lately, especially on the weekends. I have ptsd, bpd, &amp; severe GAD &amp; depression. I moved out of my parents 4 years ago to escape a toxic home. I was raised in a family who always screams at each other, constant bickering, slamming shit and breaking furniture. I have grown severe mental issues because of my childhood and flinch easily at loud noises. 

I live in a very old apartment building in a rough part of town because it’s all I can afford. Covid robbed me of my dream job &amp; all friendships, so I have been a loser sitting at home playing video games all day to escape reality while living off EI. I’m pretty sure my benefits just ended today, idk, I’ve been too scared to look. I’ve saved up 3 months worth of rent and I’m too scared to spend any money because I don’t want to get a job because I’m too adhd for university and couldn’t pick a career for the life of me. Now I’m a jobless loser with 0 ambition to be a wage slave.

I am stuck living in this apartment that *used* to be the nicer part of the shit area. Well thanks to covid, my rental management accepts anyone &amp; everyone to keep rooms filled so now there’s lots of crackheads and sketchy people who live here. The lobby is always filled with garbage now, homeless peoples bikes and garbage bags parked INSIDE the lobby while they buy crack from suite 18 bc they marked in the elevator. Oh there’s now crackheads spraying grafiti on the inside of the elevator door too. I am living in a shithole, but this is what I get for being a useless loser living in poverty.

The walls and floors are paper thin so I awoke to the couple beneath me screaming and slamming. I left the apartment at 10 am to escape the incoming panic attack I would have if I listened to it any longer. I come back at 2pm praying they would be done, but nope. Still screaming at each other. I am broke and cannot afford a lot of furniture so I hear EVERYTHING. They always slam shit so hard it shakes my floors and triggers my ptsd very badly, I think the person is getting abused downstairs so I had enough and finally called the police on them to file a domestic abuses complaint. I packed up my ps4 and let the cops in as I made my way out.

I’ve resorted to going to my parents on the weekends to avoid their slamming and fighting. I’m so sick of living in a shithole and being forced to stay away from home every fucking weekend. I miss my poor cat who is my lifeline, I don’t like having to leave her alone. But if I stay it triggers my manic depressive BPD and I’ll just lay in silence fixating on the thumping and arguing while I contemplate suicide bc I hate my fucking situation. 

No one will probably read this because it’s so long, but I’m tired of being poor. I’m tired of having noisy abuso e neighbours triggering my BPD by slamming shit shaking my floors every fucking day. I’m scared of going back to my apartment tomorrow because even though the cops came, nothing will change. I still live in a shithole and a never ending nightmare of being woke up to slamming. I’m tired of careless people. A couple weeks ago they triggered a BPD episode to the point where I punched a hole in the wall. They love to blast music and movies with their big ass bass that shakes my floors. I wrote a letter to them begging them to stop. Nothing changed. The rental company will do nothing as always. Or they’ll kick them out so crackheads will move in.

No where feels safe anymore. I miss my poor baby cat who is alone at home now. Im scared to go back to my apartment tomorrow because they’ll probably just keep slamming shit. I CSNT afford to move to a new place. I can’t find a job.

I am currently on risperidone (antipsychotic) at night time so I’m calm now, but during the day my mind is hell. My antidepressants don’t work and my doctors refuse to switch my to different ones. CBT works for a day or 2, but I’m back to a negative mindset when I have to deal with this shit at home 24/7.

If someone manages to read this all and can give advice … thank you. But I truly see suicide as the only way out of this shit life. Im tired of suffering bc other ppl are careless. Im terrified to go home tomorrow and be back to being alone with my horrible thoughts as my floors shake bc my neighbours will probably be fighting AGAIN.

I just want it to be over. I wish I could just get it over with and kill myself. Im all alone, suffering always.

To the 0 ppl who read this novel, thanks. Maybe it will be the last I ever post, I just want to die. I don’t think I’m ever escaping this hell.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
I suffer from persistent depression and my GF wants to leave me.,"I \[39M\] suffer from persistent depression. Even as a kid I've been depressed, bullied and have felt unloved and flawed due to a difficult upbringing and undiagnosed ADHD. I suffered from this well into my adulthood. Feeling broken and flawed. About three years ago I got diagnosed with ADHD and being in a bad situation with work and a bad breakup after a very long relationship led to depression diagnosis. I got CBT and was put on ADHD meds that helped out a bunch with my ADHD.  


Now on to my current situation and my reason for this post:  
About 2,5 years ago I met this great girl and we hit it of in a long distance relationship.   
She's loving, positive and very helpful. She can be short tempered though and has some insecurities.  


Unfortunately my work situation went from bad to worse and I just couldnt do it anymore. I got help and this led to some more help from a shrink but I was put on hold for almost two years now and I never felt so lonely, sad and depressed. Also the Covid19 pandemic did not help things either. Right now I am seeing another shrink and a psychiatrist that is helping me out with my ADHD meds.   


At this moment I am so tired and feel like I can not enjoy things anymore. I feel resentful and frustrated. Obviously I am in a bad place and this unfortunately damaged my relationship and my sweet girlfriend.   


I noticed her pulling away from me, getting frustrated with me and or irritated. At times I've gotten the silent treatment. Sometimes I acted out in a way that hurt her in stressful situations or moments where I felt like I've failled.  Like forgetting important things, not doing something or being late (again and again).   
She got mad or gave me the silent treatment. My anxiety got the better of me.  
Offcourse we talked, and that was difficult at times. I felt sad, misunderstood and she made it clear that she felt talking about it was a bad thing.   


Last night she told me she did not see a future for us in that way. My sombreness, some of my anxiety fueled behaviour and display of a victim mentality hurt her and have crossed certain boundaries.  
   
She meant to tell me this before, even left some breadcrumbs via text. I only noticed her pulling away, losing interest or giving me the silent treatment. I could have guessed this was on her mind but maybe I was to scared to have a talk. I feel sad that she has been dealing with this for a while and how difficult that must have been. She told me that she'd given me the benefit of the doubt a couple of weeks ago but never mentioned this to me like so. I do feel her way of going about this, her communication could have been better. But then again this must have been difficult and she told me that it felt like abandoning me.  


I am so caught up in my current mental state that I have trouble going about things. Like litterarly doing anything some days or going somewhere (on time) is hard, and I hate that!  
Dealing with my thoughts, anxiety and all that other crap made lose myself my self worth and the man I wanted to be. But i've crossed her boundaries and I completely understand why she did not want this situation anymore. She told me she still loves me and does not want to give up on me. She recognises this is my situation and that I am not the guy she fell in love with right now. She needs some time to find herself and I need to get a grip on my situation..  


I want to improve my communication and our communication.  
I want to manage my outbursts better.  
I want to manage my anxiety better.  
I want to regain my self confidence and self worth.  
I want to stop this victim mentality, I hate it!  
I want to regain trust and to reconnect.  


I could really use some advice and would love to have your input or experiences.

(TW: Suicide) I can’t stop thinking about my suicide attempt,"I attempted suicide earlier this year, and I can’t stop thinking about it even though it was a while ago.

Am I Disabled Enough?,"So it sounds like a joke but this is a true anxiety.  
My story without getting into it because its not the point just so you understand where I'm from. 

Warning for all kinds of trauma.

  
I live in Australia and I grew up in an abusive house. Mum would verbally attack my dad and the kids, he'd get drunk and beat her in front of us and around and around we go. Mum finally left him for good when I was 8 because my eldest sister turned fourteen and declared she wasn't going back and would keep me and my other sister with her at the halfway house.

So mum got a government funded house and took off in search of a good time and a new husband leaving my two older sisters to raise me. they were 14 and 12 to my 8 at the time. Left alone days at a time, my sisters pulled cash in hand work to feed us. My dad got visiting rights so when we went over there we were fed and clothed and he spoilt us rotten especially me but in unhealthy amounts. eventually my sisters stopped going but I loved it because there I could stay up as late as I want never bathe eat myself sick on junk and watch whatever adult tv I wanted. All I had to do was agree mum was a B\*tch and leave dad alone to do whatever he wanted.

meanwhile at mums place she found a miner to latch too with three kids of his own. so now we were six kids between 14-3 being left alone days at a time and sharing one room. 

  
two years later my elder sisters ran away, my father cut contact as it was too much to deal with my mother trying to see me (which i learnt to forgive him as an adult but as a kid it hurt) and we were in a slightly bigger house. it was me and my step sister in one room, my two step brothers in another and my parents in the last. again, my mother was not present, either sleeping, or out socialising or gambling or in the shed smoking. my dad either worked or joined her. Now I was the caretaker.  


Needless to say various abuse emotional verbal occasionally physical and by my teens I'm pretty messed up. I latch onto my own escape in the form of my high school boyfriend.  I'm eighteen, 140 kilos and move out of the room I share with my sister into a unit with my boyfriend who, you probably guessed it, was abusive. over time he conditioned me to stay away from technology but the tv and Xbox, cut what few friends I had out, only family I could really see without some sort of manipulative guilt trip was my mother because she'd drive me straight into his arms. He had control of everything, finances, time, everything.

so now I'm twenty three, married and pregnant with my first child. completely isolated and dependant. Police come a-knocking when I'm two months from birth and low and behold turns out my guy isn't a great fella. He had child exploitation on his Pc and planned to harm my daughter once she was born, sending photos and ultrasounds to prove intent. Oh but don't worry cause mummy was there to pick me up.

I escape her when I'm 24 and bubs nine months old for my own house but i don't fully shake her free until two years after that. Obviously as from all the above, I am not a mentally stable person. For my daughter I start to try and sort myself out. 

until my daughter is five, I took those years to do some inward looking and healing. I go to therapy, I find a antidepressant that works, I clip out the bad and keep only those positive influences.

I have Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have a medical diagnosis of only the Depression so far but the others are being worked on in therapy. When my kid is five i start dating and just before she's six I meet a wonderful guy who really IS wonderful! (I made my therapist check. He is very understanding of my trust issues and agreed to sit with me on sessions)

Now to the disabled part. currently, I am 30 with a seven year old girl and a eight month old girl. I'm in a stable relationship with a solid partner. Due to Covid and rising Rents, we were forced to move in with his parents and His sister who live with his grandparents. So yeah four generations, nine people. one house. We live in a room with my two daughters. Due to Covid and being a lifeguard during this time, my partner lost his job at the pool. So there is no employment.

Both of us have been job seeking, him about a year and me since bub was weaned. We've also been rental searching but there's just nothing in our price range and those that ARE don't want an unemployed family.

I have nightmares, PTSD flashes (for me that's flashes of rage that make me barely restrain the urge to hurt myself or very occasionally other people. Or flashes of devastation that take me out by causing hysterical sobbing and emotional pain) Panic attacks and depressive numbness that could last for days where I struggle to care about anything at all even my beautiful kids. 

I'm try, he's trying and we are drowning while my depression uses the situation to become even worse. So finally I've decided enough is enough. I'm going to the doctor to talk about options for disability and what services can help. 

so finally we come to the point of this post. Am I disabled? because as silly as it sounds reading this as if it were someone else I'd think 'yes of course' but because its ME my brain keeps saying that I'm being a fool. Ill be cast out of the doctors office and banned from Centrelink and lose everything if I try. I feel greedy and stupid and mean and lazy even thinking about applying. 

Anyone got a similar story or any idea if I'm even eligible? I swear I don't want to sit on benefits and drain resources, I just want some help getting a job that won't put me in a hospital or the ground due to my condition and maybe some help getting a place so I'm not boxed in.

Help. Depressed husband. How to best support and love?,"Hi!  I believe my husband is depressed but not completely admitting to it yet.  We have been together 14 years and have children together.  I love him dearly.  His depression has manifested itself in pushing me away, anger and hostility towards me, I believe as a defense from trauma in his childhood that has been re-triggered in the past few years.  I am basically his scapegoat for everything wrong in his life.  He also is distant, wont talk, and uses TV and books as an escape (which are at thankfully healthy) but spends considerable time in them. I would love ANY solid advice on how to navigate this.  How can I best love him through this?  Especially if his instinct right now is to push me away.  Any “do’s or don’ts?”  Can I leave affirmations / encouragement for him in the form of notes?

Nothing feels good,"22M…. Literally nothing feels good. 

I spend my day solving tediously difficult problems with little resources and poor instructions. Hours of frustration. 

Eating is just another chore that doesn’t bring any joy, unless I eat bullshitjj foods in which case again it will make me feel even worse than the little pleasure it brought me. 

Masturbating is basically a desperation attempt for something to feel good but honestly its just lack luster, there is no real desire. And if I watch porn it will feel good, but I don’t because porn will make me feel even worse after. 

There is no emotional support from anyone, no one cares about a young mans feelings. 

Finishing at the gym makes me feel a little good, but its fucking exhausting and the energy and effort I put into it feels as shitty if not more so than the little dopamine I get after. 

I think this is where my problems with women come in. I want them badly, because sex with women feels awesome. Having a woman around is validating and feels awesome. Cuddling feels awesome. It feels like a woman is the only thing that can bring good feeling into my life without having an immediate and often worse downside. And I know this is problematic thinking. 

Everything just feels shit. And everything that feels good will make you pay.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Medication mood drops,"Hi, I've been on two medications for a short time. Clomipramine for my depression and Methylphenidate (commonly known as ritalin) for ADHD. While I have noticed and upturn in my general mood, it seems to drop throughout the day at regular times. Before 10am, I'm actually quite good and productive. By 11, I can feel a real drop in my mood. By 1pm I'm completely gone and miserable for the rest of the day.

Basically I'm just wondering if others have experienced this kind of mood drop when put on meds.

My bf have suicidal thoughs recently,"Frankly I don't know what to do.

Today after a pretty regular day he just started to message me telling me that's he's mood was down.

Then he told me he has been planning on taking his life. I try to tell him a lot of people love him, he has a lot of things to do (24yo) and everything can be fixed.

He keeps telling me that no one can help him or that it can't be fixed.

He just told me he don't want me to suffer.

I told him that I love him and this is not the way to fix it, I will talk to him tomorrow in person.

All of this happened before I leave home and went to my house.

I wish this is just a depressed moment. I will stay with him and try to change his mind.

Do people actually care?,"Sorry for the title, but it really is the best way to put it. Everyone says they care about me, want me to live, to message them if I ever feel like doing it. But I've noticed a pattern, those same people talk about me behind my back, those same people often want me alive, but not necessarily around. 

My question is this, am I right to think that people as a whole are a lot more fake and cold than they're willing to admit? Because I see a lot of words being said but I've yet to meet someone who I actually believe cares.

This post may seem self centered but I ask it out of frustration, I try my best to fight through it, for others. To be there for others. To care for others. Yet I struggle to find evidence of reciprocation besides empty words.

The only reason I'm alive today is because I promised I wouldn't hurt those around me by doing it, but I'm feeling like they wouldn't actually care?

"I'm done,","Oi, im Ron a 17 year living in brazil attending the 2° grade in high school and I've reached a point in my life where I want to give up everything. 
Imma introvert teen with no friends, broke, weird and useless 
So i will try to explain exactly my situation 
Everyday i go to school and i see the girl i like with someone better than me i wonder wtf its wrong with me and why i can't have any type of relationship, i spent 3 months talking to this girl until she tell me she only see me as a friend. And that's not the first time 
In my life I've been close with 3 girls which I've really come close to relating to have something 
And they always tell me dat... 
Even though they say they want to be my friends they actually become people i used to know 
And when the thing is having friendships thats just something I don't have I see everybody having a group of friends hanging out having fun while all i have is nothing
About my family and financial situation is even worst 
I've been 3 weeks out the school working illegally 8 hours before i get fired (probably i got scammed and at this point i dont have nothing else to do) at some day i look myself at mirror and start wondering why i was live in such a situation it ain't right for a teen be living like that i was dreaming with school dreaming with study and when classes are over I go out with friends to eat something smoke cigrettes talk about life, dreaming with a date and stuff. 
But now im back to school and i feel like a zombie there
In this week im moving to a smaller house cuz my mom can't afford the place i am rn and all this stuff make me hate my country, and yeah the thing i most hate in this life it's this country i could be having a better life in anyplace and maybe its not worth immigrate somewhere by my shit nationality 
And about my physical situation i can say im handsome even though being very skinny and hating my body, all i wish was eating 5 times per day for gain weight and i can even start in gym cuz i can't pay for that 
So basically all This shit made me lose the will to live. Every day i think about killing myself. All i want its a real reason to live and to be happy

Step son quit working &amp; refuses help,"My stepson has some undiagnosed mental issues along with anxiety and depression. A couple months ago he lost his job because he wasn't showing up to work.

I know he makes a few dollars here and there but I'm not sure how. He never leaves his house and he refuses any help man's mother offer him unless my wife just offers to give him cash. We have learned that he has been doing some sort of drugs off and on for several years.

About a year and a half ago we had to spend a lot of money to get his house out of foreclosure because he hadn't been paying the bills. I know he isn't paid his mortgage and several months now so at some point they're going to foreclose on him and kick him out.

I'm just not sure what to do. When he stays with us he argues with his mom Non-Stop if she even asks him to take a shower. He doesn't clean up after himself and when you goes to the bathroom he makes a huge mess. It's hard for me to even think about living with that.

But if I tell her he can't stay here if he's not working or showering or cleaning up after himself, she just says that she's afraid he'll be homeless or kill himself.

Unable to think clearly,"Like the title says, I'm unable to think clearly. It's like the gears in my brain is covered with gunk and is just not moving smoothly.

No alcohol in quite a while and I've reduced how much caffeinated soda or any soda I drink because I was addicted to it. I'm getting decent exercise too. 

But I just can't think well. Or concentrate for that matter. That's the one thing I've got, you know? My brain. Doing innovative things at work is one of the only things I'm proud of and that's letting me down. And I'm fucking nervous all the time. It's like there's something clutching me in my chest 24/7.

College student wondering if checking myself in to a hospital would be the best option— any advice? What was it like/how much did it cost financially?,"Hi everyone, hoping I can get some advice on what to do in the next couple days.

I’ve been seriously thinking of killing myself for about four/five months (definitely had suicidal thoughts before that for many many years, but I didn’t start thinking it though or planning anything out until now). I’m starting to finally feel like I’m reaching the end, lol. 

I genuinely believe that I do not have the capacity to harm myself in any way, significantly or even slightly. So I kind of feel like I’d be lying when I tell them I have “intent” that’s more than just thoughts, although I do have many plans I’m hoping I can go through with when I’ve finally reached my limit (so I’m afraid they won’t admit me anyways). I’m trying to weigh the pros/cons of trying to get myself admitted and so far I’ve only been able to come up with cons:

My worries/concerns:

* I have no idea how much a stay or checking myself in would cost. I believe that this worrying would leave me off a lot worse than I am now.

* I’d also be worrying about what my friends/family are thinking while I’m gone and how I'm just causing them unnecessary stress (it'd be a shock for them as they don't know any of this)

* I’d also be worrying about missing my classes/assignments/a midterm and how I would catch up afterward

* I feel like I’d be generally miserable for however long I’m there

* I think it might make me miserable enough to actually commit suicide after I leave, although 

I feel like I wouldn’t be able to effectively kill myself and then would have to go through the whole process of hospitalization over again.
I just don’t see that many pro’s in checking myself in, but I don’t really know what else to do. Could anyone who’s gone through the process give some guidance?

Thank you.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Does anyone else feel like the world is incredibly dark?,"I’ve never been treated nicely by anyone. Even the kids that are more rejected by other kids are mean to me. I’ve never been mean to a single person in my life but i get treated like shit constantly. I don’t know why but when I was a kid I imagined the world was a place full of empathy but literally every single person I’ve met has been an unempathetic piece of shit. 

I’m in a friend group that’s so toxic it led one of the kids in our friend group to a suicide attempt with a gun but it ended up missing his brain (I imagine he got scaredd and moved it at the last second). And even AFTER he attempted and was in the hospital they continued to treat him like shit and told him he should’ve just gone through with it. Don’t worry, they also treat me like shit, I’m in a similar position to him and I can’t leave because I have no other friends. Not only that, but I treat the guy that attempted suicide with absolute kindness, I’ve never been mean to him which you’d expect him to be thankful for right? Nope, he actually treats me like shit more than the other kids and he even fought me a month ago simply because he hates me that much.

And it’s not like I have a bad personality, I’m extremely funny in groups of people, like it’s not uncommon for me to have people tearing up cause they laugh so much, but everyone still hates me and treats me like dirt. 

I’m not exaggerating here, but when I imagine the world outside my bedroom I genuinely imagine darkness and madness everywhere. Imagine nightmare on elm street dreams where every house is empty or whatever and it’s always night outside and there’s just a feeling of terror.

I’ve been defeated by everything,"I’m treated like shit by the “friends” I have, literally people I don’t even know will treat me like shit and give me a “you’re not good looking enough or cool to be talking to me” attitude if I try to interact with anybody, and I’m the most socially awkward person I or any other person I know has ever seen. I have no one to help me either because my parents get mad at me for showing and signs of distress.

How do I feel human again?,"For the longest time I have had the issue of feeling like a subhuman or a tool meant to have specific purposes, I have been struggling for the longest time with trying to accept I'm a person too and deserve to be treated as such, that I'm deserving of love, or to stop putting the needs of others before mine.

I won't go into details about what originated this, because frankly no one wants to read Infinite Jest lengths of backstory, but I'd like, if anyone can relate, to get some tips on how to ""ground"" myself again because I'm feeling really, really disconnected from myself lately, even more so than usual, and it's very hard to just go thru the motions to maintain the illusion of just being a normal, functional person (which I do more for the sake of others than mine tbh). 

I fear that I'll be exposed as a subhuman and be further alienated from others if I can't keep up the façade and I don't have the time or energy to move elsewhere again to start anew for the nth time.

Btw I don't think that tips suggesting hanging with friends or family will work since I'm essentially an immigrant all alone in a country other than for his bf, so I don't really have a ""safety net"" in a traditional sense (and don't want to burden my partner further).

my “celeb obsession “ has triggered my depression&amp; I know it’s pathetic but I need some support.,"I feel like a loser writing this but I need help. I am 28 F which makes it more embarrassing. I’ve never had celebrity crushes until I was first diagnosed with clinical depression and I went into a rabbit hole. I’ve always had this old soul thing, where I’ve always had nostalgia for past decades, not only the aesthetic but thinking my life would be better in a different decade ( especially seeing the world with Covid )

I also deleted my social media 1 year ago Bc how bad it affect my mental state and only came on Reddit to get support. 

I got out of it, but a little background is I am a survivor of (childhood&amp; adult sexual abuse) &amp; never had a real relationship due to it. I was doing well mentally until I had to see my abuser (which is one of my family members) 
by accident by walking into a family event and not knowing they would be there. 

Fast forward to now I am 28F. I went to a concert. It was a 80s rock band. Being a rock and roll super fan I love as excited to see this band. They were amazing live &amp; I’ve always had a crush on the young version of the guitarist. 
I’ve read his books and watched his interviews in the past. 

after the concert I found a way to stalk his Instagram &amp; watch all his old interviews &amp; old performances. Triggering my obsession. 

I’ve spent days watching it but realized it’s ruining me and the young version of him doesn’t even exist. He’s old and ugly now.

I just became obsessed with the thought that if I was alive in the 80s I could of dated Him and be apart of the exciting life of rock n roll. 

I realized I’m just seeking excitement and validation and nostalgia. I also feel I will never be in a relationship due to my past abuse.

How do I stop being victimized?,"(sorry for my English, not English speaker)

A friend asked me to send him a bike by a postal service. I was already with a lot of things in my head, i knew I had to wrap the bike, but couldnt find much cardboard.

When I got to the place there was this dude that attended the postal service that i know from the start that just wanted to take advantage of me as people of low life/class usually do around here.

I already was at a defensive state, and then he invented some extra fee for wrapping the bike. I knew what was going on. I played the fool and as i was too tired to get more cardboard, or wrap it, or have any trouble, i paid that illegal extra fee.

But i felt really taken advantage of, and this guy also waved a knife around, so i would get intimidated. I was already intimidated just by being next to this low class douche that could get around with any shit he pulls, and i knew that for him i was just the next victim.

(funny thing is that i try to not react bad to low class people, so they don't ger offended, but now I'm thinking this interaction was already spoiled by this low life thug, as the bad vibe i fell was all his act to take advantage of me).

But i think that given all the options (I knew everything that was going on), i handled him the fee and this extra fee... But of course now I feel really bad, i hate imagining this dude celebrating that he scammed another dude with this shit.

I was afraid that if i did otherwise this low class people would damage the bike or something like that... And the sad thing is that they may do that either way. But at the moment i was also afraid of the bike safety.

I felt it was a burden to react and just complain, but now i felt this blame, i felt like a coward that succumb to this low class guy intimidation, and this guy taken advantage of me.

When something like this happen i always say next time i don't even care if everything goes to hell. But then this happens i take this ""solutions"" but the regretted as i feel as a coward or a fool.

It would ease my mind if I could find other cases or how to deal with this kind of situation where you feel helpless.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Helping a friend with depression,"Heyy there!
I just found out that a very good online friend of mine suffers from depression and feeling down.

Initally she just asked for advice regarding a crush of hers who already is in a relationship. When talking to her about it tho, she told me a few things that really got me worried.
On the one hand, she feels understood by him. She feels like herself around him and like she doesn't have to fake her happiness.
On the other hand, she admitted to sending him nudes, as he told her I'd be okay to send some from time to time and it could even be there 'hot little secret'

Needless to say, I'm really worried now. I gave her the advice to stay away from him/stop contact with him and also came to an agreement, that her and I would look for a psychologist at the same time (so niether of us feels like a crazy person needing psychiatric help lol)

Still, I'll continue to try and help her. I already thought about asking her how she feels (although it is incredibly hard for her to open up about her feelings), but also motivating her to go out or try something new or something.

Just fyi: I never met her personally, she lives about two hours away. We do talk (jokingly) about meeting up some time soon tho, so maybe I'll see her soon.

Advice when dating someone with depression?,"Hello everyone! I’m here to just ask some questions on what did some of y’all do to help your partners that suffer severe depression and anxiety. 

I’ve currently been talking to this person and we both hit it off right from the bat. I’m talking scarily accurate stuff that we have in common. This person then told me “since we are talking more frequently, I figured I’d let you know I suffer severe depression and anxiety. So it’s hard to keep in touch with people who have it and I understand if you don’t wanna be around.”(clearly warning me that our convos won’t be like this) Of course my answer was “I totally understand! Just know I’m always around if you wanna ear to listen to :)” 

So it’s been two months now and I know some of y’all would think “why are you so invested, go live your life” which I have been doing. But if it does work out and we do date for real. What advice can I do for me when im in this? This is just so im aware. 

In my eyes it’s clear we like each other, despite it only online. I’ve tried to see if I could do what my friends told me and it’s to try and meet other people. But none of them clicked like how it clicked with the person I’m talking to. They tell me she probably leading you on and I would simply say, “ well why would they send 8 min audios about what we’re talking about? Or literally offer to watch one of my fav Anime in theaters the next month? It’s her depression bro.”

She and I were both looking forward to this because she would’ve qualified for Medicare today.   And we could’ve finally gotten some help for some of her issues and some caregiving relief for me.  

Mom passed two years ago and I’ve never been quite ok since.   It’s funny how stuff such as transferring her from her bed to her chair, bandaging wounds, and even cleaning up accidents is stuff you’d end up missing after they are gone.  Just to have them back.  

All this is added to Mom and I’s dog, Harper, had to be put down in June for kidney failure.  My last family.  

So, now it’s just me.   The sole survivor of being a family caregiver for 13 years, to sift through memories upon memories by myself.  And the weight of today is just a lot.    
And it’s really taxing my anxiety and just putting me back in grief and darkness.   

They should both still be here.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

#…[ALL of them **REJECTED** me!](https://imgur.com/gallery/3M3xXRI)


Was I really that bad?  After 20 years of singing and study, was I really so bad that each and everyone of these companies decided to reject me? [No more empty compliments, was I honestly that bad of a singer that every company I applied for had to reject me?](https://youtu.be/HjnDEBoHPUA)

Opera is the only thing in this miserable world that gives me any meaning to my life.  I don’t want people to say life is supposed to be meaningless, I don’t want people to say that there will be a next time, And I don’t want people to reassure me of anything anymore.  Rejecting me from each of these companies was somebody’s decision, and I want to know exactly why they made it against me!  

Was because they are doing diversity hiring and couldn’t fit a white person into their principal lineup?  Was it because I’m a military veteran, and someone looked me up to make a stink about it?  Was it because I have trouble getting social media followers?  Was it because I’m autistic? **ANSWER ME GOD DAMNIT**! This isn’t about how I feel, this is about what these people are doing to me, and I want to know why they are doing it to me after I have earned my place!

I have been living with depression, anxiety and tendencies for the last 15 years, trying to rebuild my life. People always say bull crap like don’t give up.  Well I’ve brought back the latest result of not giving up! And I’m putting them out there so that the assholes who make those kind of lies can fix this!  I’ve posted my audition results from every company to whom I’ve submitted this audition season, to show you that telling me not to give up isn’t changing their decision to reject me!   

I want a change in this!  I want these companies to relay to me exactly why they rejected me so that I can improve, Or else I want them to change their decisions, So that “not giving up” becomes a reality for me as much as it does for anybody else you tell it to!!!  Do you want my life to not be worthless? Do you want me to keep on going? Fix this for me!

Making the same mistake years later.,"Hello, sorry for a long post. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you for whoever reads this.

I'll start with events 4 years ago when it all started.  I am 22 year old male. I used to work in a bar where I met a girl I instantly fell in love with . We got to know each other well, went on dates etc. She was everything I ever wished for.

I'm from a small village and I have some good friends here. We  were always considered to be the  ""bad guys"" because we partied a lot etc. I never done drugs thought.

She always assumed I do drugs and one day I decided to take some to impress her ( stupid I know) I guess to keep up with the bad guy reputation. Problem is, I fell in love with cocaine.

And that's when my life went into a downwards spiral. I started taking cocaine for breakfast everyday. I turned it an angry mess, our relationship slowly got ruined. I was angry at her one day and tried sleeping with her best friend. I was nothing but a scumbag. I was a cheating,  lying scumbag. I didn't see that at the time but now it's very clear for me to see. She deserved better than me

After overdosing once, We broke up and she moved away. I decided I had enough and went sober.  I went through some very rough time then. I was very deeply hurt and depressed. Day by day it got better. 

4 years have passed and I still never fully got over her even when I was with other girls but I was living more or less fine. I don't really like this town but I have some great friends and reasonably good new job.

Anyway, after all these years, last weekend I was out drinking with friends and I met an old friend who offered me a bag of cocaine for some reason i  snapped back to my old habits and bought a bag.

I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol. And out of all the placed I could of met her again she walked in to the kitchen where I was dashing out lines of cocaine in a state where I could barely stand or speak. I tried telling her I wasn't the man I was when we first met,  but of course she didn't believe it, why would she ?  Somehow I managed to achieve some sort of success with her. We danced and kissed etc. But she's probably just lonely since coming back to town since most of her friends are gone away. We never had sex that night but I couldn't have sex even if I wanted to due to state I was in.

I woke up next morning and all my feeling for her came back, all the love it took me years to forget, but I knew that it was over, it was just a one night thing. It crushed me. All these years breaking away from my habits wasted when it came down to a person it mattered. I was still the same lying drug addict in her eyes as I was 4 years ago.

It's been a week and I feel empty, only emotion I have is constant hint of anger and sadness in me. I stopped eating or doing anything except working , I work 9-5 and then I go to my garage where I work on projects and drink alcohol until am I able to sleep. Maybe I am still the same scumbag I was 4 years ago. Iv been having suicidal thoughts but I know I can't do that since I need to look after my family. I would rather suffer myself then let my family suffer. 

At first I thought it was just a comedown from drugs since I haven't touched them in so long. But I still miss her more and more everyday. I have dreams about her at night where we are happy together. I messaged her a few times but she's always busy and takes a long time to reply.

I'm just so lost, all these years to recover just to slip back into my old days when it mattered the most. She gave me an opportunity to fix what I once broke but instead I proceeded to ruin it further. 

Thank you to whoever reads this. I just wanted to get this of my chest or speak to someone anonymously.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1
Question about other conditions causing depression?,"Hello! 

I'm new, so I hope this is ok to post.

I've been dealing with depression for many years, but feel like I only was able to put a name to and call it that for the past 5 years. 

I feel like my depression makes me struggle with motivation and avoidant about certain things I have to do for work. Recently though I have been struggling to determine if my inability to do focused work is due to my depression or if I have underlying attention issues.

Does anyone have advice or experience with this? Can't having attention issues (like ADHD) make you frustrated and as a result depressed if untreated? How can you tell them apart? I have also have a similar question about undiagnosed autism and social isolation. How can you tell them apart?

Depressed International Student; need help,"Hi,

I'll try to explain my situation as best as I can and I will highly appreciate if you can read it completely. In any case, I'll try to summarize everything in a TLDR at the bottom. Thanks for your time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an international student who is stuck overseas in my home country (India) due to COVID from the last one and half year. I am studying in a good university on a student loan which is huge. I come from a lower-middle class family and my parents can't even speak English. My parents have very conservative Indian mentality and it is impossible for them to understand my situation.

Just after my high school, I was selected into very prestigious engineering colleges in India called IIT. I studied there for an year and got super depressed as I came to understand how the real life is. I decided to take a transfer to a very good university in Australia. I thought it would make me feel better but it did come with a hefty student loan. I was a kid I guess, I don't think there is anything that can make me feel better.

I am currently in my last year and working towards writing my honours thesis. I have been pretty stressed about general life and how exactly I will repay my loan and live a normal life. I have tried applying to a lot of internships but I got more than 50 rejections already and I have no more motivation to apply anywhere now. I don't feel anything at all. The only reason why I study or do any work is to get high marks. That's it. Very recently (last month or two), I have been even slacking off in the study part. I have also started smoking cigarettes and doing marijuana edibles every other day.

Every day, I wake up at 10 already tired and swearing about everything (in my mind, I live at my parent's home rn). I attend a few zoom group project meetings, staying silent mostly and trying to look like I did the minimal amount of work to not get thrown out of the group. Then I try to feel better, make a huge list of assignments coming up and write down how much is each of them worth. I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that it's already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two (my friend doesn't smoke). While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible (legal), eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents won't know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 2-3 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep. Then, I wake up next day exhausted at 10 and the cycle goes on.

I also feel pretty dumb as I have almost no progress on my thesis. My professor thinks that I am smart but I am not. I just slack and slack and come up with some excuse for not doing the work. I just make some dumb and vague presentations an hour before the meeting. From last two weeks, I haven't even done that. I just make some excuse and try to portray myself as the victim. I have one more semester left for my thesis and I think I should just quit. But I can't because then how will I pay for my loan. I am also not getting any internships, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job. I thought maybe I'll start a PhD degree as I am not really getting anything else and I'll at least get some stipend regularly if I get the scholarship. My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now. I have to submit a draft of a literature review on Monday (rn it's Saturday night) which will be of around 15 pages and I haven't even started yet. I don't think I can do it and I don't think I deserve all this.

Oh also, if you haven't guessed it yet, no I have no friends. The friend I go out every evening is a very old friend who is probably the only person I talk to. He is a good person, I have tried telling him my situation but I don't think he understands it and I don't blame him. He has a completely different life and we are two different people.

I also have suicidal thoughts but the only reason I avoid thinking about it in detail is that if I die, my student loan will fall on my parents and that is just awful of me to that to them. I feel my existence is totally useless and I will bring nothing but misery to this universe. I don't think there is any point in living. I won't even get a job overseas. I will probably just get a mediocre job in India which will pay me average salary through which I will never be able to pay my loan. Probably will die with a debt on my head.

Old classmates from the college I left (IIT) have amazing jobs and I see most of them travelling and enjoying their life in beaches and clubs and whatnot. I know I shouldn't compare but in reality, I do. I just feel that I was that dumb guy who left such a college to get into this huge pile of shit. I wasn't happy there but am I happy now? Life is just a grind and the sooner I understand it, the better it will be for me. I don't have any hobbies except watching Youtube and masturbating and doing drugs.

Anything I can do? Is it possible for me to get out of the hole I dug myself for? Is there any hope for me? Is there anyone who can relate to my situation because I don't know anybody who can?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: An international student in an Australian uni studying online from my home country (India) from last one and half years. Living with my parents, smoking and doing marijuana edibles (legal) regularly. In my last year doing bachelor's honours thesis and continuously slacking in everything. No success in internship/job applications and feeling extremely stressed about repaying the loan (to the point of suicide). No social life and my family is too conservative to understand a single line of this post. Looking for some direction, someone who can relate to anything in this post or just in general help.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously a throwaway account, I doubt that anyone can identify me but if you do pls don't text me about it, it's just gonna make me feel worse. Also, I forgot to mention, Coming from a conservative lower-middle class family in India, I can't afford actual therapy plus considering my conservative environment, I can't really talk about this with anyone.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1

I've been diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder for 6 going on 7 years. Currently I'm on 60mg nuzak to treat my depression. I've been feeling like it doesn't work anymore. I've said this to my psychiatrist, and ive tried to make appointments time and time again. She just doesn't get back to me. When I do have an appointment she's about 30 minutes late for a 30 minute appointment. I'm just feeling incredibly frustrated with this. I get that she's busy and that life happens but its impossible to reach her. 

Im going to a new psychiatrist at the end of the month. Should I share these experiences? Should I share that I think my dosage is a bit high for not working well? I'm nervous about this. I just don't want to feel dismissed again. 

I feel a little defeated. Like I do a lot to manage my mental well-being but its like the therapies and meds just never help. I don't know how many more times I need to tell someone I'm sad in a therapy session.

I feel so empty,"It’s been nearly four months since my dog passed.   And I’ve had maybe a handful of good days.   

I can’t even make a ham sandwich without getting upset sometimes.  I’ve been up since midnight and I can’t get back to sleep. 

My sleep patterns are all over the place.   Setting a set time for sleep just adds to my stress.  And the. My anxiety goes all haywire.   

I did start one of my hobbies back up, but I noticed I can easily get lost in it and blow time I need to do chores or run errands.  And while it’s good distraction , it hasn’t gotten its joy back yet.  

Just finding a new routine without my caregiving duties, and especially without my/my Mom’s dog has just been hell.

It’s like I can’t even be happy with anything because I don’t have anyone to share it with who cares.   Even when my dog was here, I still felt pride that I was doing good for her and making her life a little better.

3 years ago I begged my parents to take me to a psychologist and my parents were shocked and said ""our daughter is not crazy"" and shut down the topic as quickly as they could. Like end of discussion. 

This lead to my attempted suicide and even that they covered up, said to the emergency doctors that what happened just happened by ""accident"".

Advice?,"Hi, 

In advance! I’m not the best out there on explaining my feelings since that’s very far away from my culture, but I’ll try because I don’t know what else to do. 

I’m 26 and not too long ago I changed my career path to something which I’ve always wanted to do. Prior to this, which was about a year and a half ago I felt as though I’ve been in an emotional hole I couldn’t get out of. My new job distracted me for a long while, I was even being complimented on how I suddenly seemed like “myself” again up until about 6 months ago, when I just fell back in to my own bullshit of complete and utter numbness.

The issue is, that normally lasts a few weeks for me but it’s been 6 months (or longer) now and I can’t seem to shake it. I don’t want to speak to anybody, I love my family and friends but I can’t seem to…make the effort I guess? This resulted in me losing important connections and even severing them because I can’t for the life of me understand what the point of them is when I can’t be a good person to them. Then I have the audacity to feel loneliness and feel even more sorry for myself 😂 When I do talk to the people I have left I can’t focus on the conversation and I just drift off in to absolutely nothing, so it never lasts long. 

My question is to those who have managed to get through this without medication (I can’t have medication due to the nature of my job) How did you manage to do it? Am I missing something? I will do everything I possibly can to help myself but I’ve tried so much. I got back in the gym, I’m eating well, I’ve meditated, I’ve gone for walks, I’ve listened to music to self medicate, I’ve slept decent amounts. I can’t seem to enjoy doing anything anymore and my passion for life has been put out like someone suddenly pissed on a bonfire. I feel like I get closer and closer to giving up everyday and I’m just too close to it this time to the point I’m starting to scare myself every now and again with the thoughts that come in to my mind. 

Any suggestions would help so much.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
medical mystery causing me depression," 

usually antipsychotics/with SSRI help me a lot but its just been fucked lately, i've had one of my worst relapses ever for the past 11 days

I just feel like i'm stuck in some alternate world of dissociation, i usually get a warning before this happens - an intrusive sensation comes on, and i focus on the feeling and suck it in, i than immediately surrender to this feeling and say ''yup It's happening again'' or if i try to fight away the sinking feeling, it gets deeper the discomfort and the dissociation goes into my head, than i get a weird feeling in my body, i don't know if it is in my arms or my neck muscles, but it sucks.

It's highly distressing.

I have diagnosed OCD.

Am i going crazy? part of me just wants to take the recommended dosage for schizophrenia to make sure i am not actually schizophrenic.

For 2 years my life was perfect, now it's in crisis again, My damn GP said it will take too long to see a psychiatrist or get to see one, and he wants me to wait to see if the extremely small upping of my antipsychotic dose will help, which clearly it has not, it has been 9 days and i have still had an episode every freaking night, it all dates back to that one traumatic event i had in 2016, i wish that night never happened and i would forever be a normal happy person, instead i am now a fucked up crazy person.

Apart of me wishes i had a bullet to just take the pain away of this sensation, it feels like i am talking to a bunch of ghosts on reddit when i ask this, people don't get this feeling follows me around, it is a part of me, a part of my brain that is actively seeking to hurt me and only the meds can block it","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

Could a vitamin D deficiency be causing depression entirely?,"I've been severely depressed and suicidal for well over a year at this point, but I've noticed that it started easing a bit around March/April (the start of winter in my country) and then worsening again in August/September (the start of summer), while I was actually happy in June and July, and any moments of suicidal ideation were anxiety driven, not depression. 


In winter, because it's cold, I spend most of the day lazing in the sun (yes, I know skin cancer, but I don't care), so about 4-5 hours of consistent sunlight at least. In summer, I stay out of the sun entirely because it's too hot and I absolutely hate the heat.

So this makes me think that something is particularly bad in summer to make me significantly more depressed than winter. Perhaps that's a vitamin D deficiency.

Has that been the case for anyone else?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
My ex husband dead because of me and I hate living,"I married my ex husband when I was 18. We had 2 kids together.  I already had 2. There was ups and downs. Good times and bad ones but something that stayed constant was he wouldn't work. I went to nursing school with the promise he would take care of the home. This didn't happen.  After 7 years of this and also quite a bit of mental abuse I divorced him. The kids started getting into trouble and were so upset.  Plus to be honest I missed him. I went back. I did this for 8 more years. Meanwhile he had developed quite the tab habit. And me overdrawn everyday day trying to feed habits and kids. I didn't leave again til it got so bad he was needing stronger and stronger things and me and the 2 girls left at home had no running water or lights. It was hard without family.  He begged and begged me to come back. Just like last time. He also played bad guy and even tried to get me fired. He died less then a year after we left. He was in a crack house. High on heroin and fentanol. His kids devastated.  So now here am i.. with all the things ppl know I went through.  And I have to be strong for the kids. But there was some good times too. Some only him and I shared. He understood me like no one else. He wasn't always a drug addict.Maybe I actually hoped subconsciously that he would get better and we could try again. After all I had never cared about anyone like I do him. All I know is I miss him so fucking much! I cry every day.  I dont wanna live without him. Everything and I mean everything makes me think of him.. and I'm so lost. I cant believe he left me. He left me here without him and it hurts so damn bad and I dont know how to make it stop. I just want him.... and all this im feeling roaring in me like a fire. I cant say a word.. to no one. No one understands because what I went through.  And I cant tell my kids. I have to be strong for them. They hurt too. So this is how I am truly silently feeling everyday.  My world is crushed, I feel like I cant breath, cant think, much  less want to. I know my kids still need me so I will stay but I really just don't wanna be here anymore.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Slipping back into a depressive episode, but this time the stress in not very manageable","Basically, to sum it up:

&gt;moved from overseas back to the states. Month or so later move to CA with family member, because they said I could have a really good opportunity. Their job fell through, we move back to home state. Ended up moving Moved to a new place with a family member in a different city months later. Covid starts. No job. Family member says I have a few years with them and it’s okay. Fast forward to this year - they get into a relationship and now want to move in with them / kick me out. 

I have no car because their extra car went to my other family member (who already had two cars) for I don’t know why. They told me I could share their car it’s no problem, assuming in a year or so I’d be good enough to move out. 

But now I have 6 months, little work, no car, and I have to be ready to go somewhere. I’ve done about 20 or 25 applications and only three got back to me saying no. I feel like the whole reason I was able to stay with my family member was out of obligation and they were lonely. Now since they aren’t lonely, it’s now my fault for not working during Covid and being “ambition-less” - despite pouring time into now what’s a contracted job of audio engineering (audio is my passion). 

So now I have less than a year and at the moment months before I’m homeless. I’m not on my meds anymore, I was on viibryd for a while. Now I’m starting to feel like there is an easy way out of this.  I feel like my situation isn’t my fault, but to my family member they think I deserve this. 

One thing that annoys me is that we would make a deal in which I can do x and y for my family member and I would get paid weekly for it during Covid . But that always ended up falling through because they quit.  Also the fact that the premise of their thoughts was that they are lonely , won’t find anyone, so no rush. But now they found someone to settle with, and suddenly im put into this situation. 

There is a lot more, but it’s risky to say because of my family members social status.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

My mom said I'm faking depression,"Hey everyone, I've never posted here but I hope you're all well. I really need some advice if you have any. 

I go to one of the top universities in North America and am currently in my 5th year. These past 2 years have had me feeling really low and I've been thinking about seeing a therapist because I may have depression. I feel very demotivated and tired even though my work load is insane and I can't afford to slack. Often times I feel very worthless, a burden, and a waste of space. I also binge eat which makes those feelings worse. The eating has gotten a LOT better but it still had its moments.

Anyway, I've been wanting to sew a therapist but I need insurance which had been kind of holding me back. My dad's insurance covers the whole family (I live at home, for cultural reasons) but he and my mom would be able to see who uses it. After a year, the feelings got worse and I made the decision, after much deliberation, to tell my mom that I would like to see a therapist and that I would like to use the insurance. She said okay and j started looking but most were fully booked or not taking new patients. 

Today, we were discussing my sister's divorce. Her ex had depression and was one of the reasons they got a divorce. My mom says that anyone who has depression shouldn't get married, and that it applies to me. She said that she thinks I'm faking it for attention because it's not visible to her. She said if I do think I have it, I should forget about finding love or getting married. I interpreted her words to mean that people it depression are unworthy of love and that I would ruin someone's life like my sister's ex ruined hers. 

I don't know, the feelings are kind of intense right now and I don't want to cry but there's a lump in my throat and I just want to sleep but I have a huge midterm tomorrow and I have to see her later and my sister is of no help

I feel like a waste and I don't know what to do.,"Where do I begin? 

I guess to start, I recently got engaged to the love of my life back in June (you'll see why this is important in a second). I am also in a very demanding work industry, in education. Special Education to be more specific. I love working with kids and it can be very rewarding, however, it's the most taxing job. 

My fiancé is a very supportive person while also keeping me realistic. My dream is to stream and I used to and it was fairly successful, to my surprise, when I started. I gained a lot of followers, viewers, and even a few donations (even though that's not why I started to do it). My stream was focused on just having fun doing hobby and trying to shine light on mental health. My #1 passion in life is to help others. And I have tried to find careers that revolve around that, but to much dismay. So my stream was to offer advice when asked, listen, and just talk. Talking helps. Even talking about random things. Anyways, she supported me while I did this during the summer. I knew it bugged her that she had to go to work every day and I got to stay home and fulfill a passion of mine.  

I am drowning at work and it has completely taken over my life. I find no joy in my old hobbies. Watching sports, playing video games, hanging with friends, etc. This past week my fiancé told me that I remind her of a hermit. I hate going out, hanging with friends, all that. I hate having fun is what she told me. Frankly, I realized this before she had told me. 

Furthermore, I am faced with the decision of resigning from my job and chasing my dream. The repercussions of this is that there won't be stable income coming from me, my fiancé doesn't make enough right now to support us both and we talked about it. We were looking to buy a house in the next year, as well. 

I feel like I'm a waste though. Do I just ""nut up"" and suffer just to achieve the goal of getting a house? And even if I do that, how do I know that I will even make it to see that day given I suffer day in and day out? Or chase my dream and lose that goal of getting a house, putting financial strain on my relationship and run the risk of not getting married to the one?

I was always told to chase my dreams and stop at nothing until I am there and here I am faced with the decision and I'm ready to jump but at what cost?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Which antidepressant worked for you?,"Hi all,
I've been actively fighting my depression for years, since I realize it was there. I've been taking Lexapro for a couple years now. Seems to take the edge off the worst of it but like today I woke up really depressed, ie: don't want to live anymore, life feels meaningless and just endless pain and disappointment, I feel like I serve everyone around me and no one really cares about me.

I'm not suicidal...well let's be real, I am because of the depression but I've decided not to remove myself from life... That'll happen whether I like it or not and it'll always be an option but since it's so permanent I'd prefer to see if I can fix my brain and be delusionaly happy like normal people.

So what worked for people? Appreciate it before I try the permanent option.

Deep depression and struggling marriage,"Hope this is withing the guidelines and acceptable:)

Is there anyone going through something similar or can relate? I'm in a marriage that I have been struggling for years and things just aren't getting better. I am 30plus with 2 children under 6 yrs old and been married/together 10ish years. If I get too emotional, I just get left alone till I calm down. Hasn't ever looked into how to help. I am not and never have been suicidal or wasn't to hurt myself or anyone. However, my depression can consume me sometimes and I have a day where I barely move, hah. I never let the kids see me like that, but it gets exhausting. I react ""emotionally"" and basically get ignored. If we fight or my spouse is mad at me and I cry, I get ignore. My spouse cries? Especially if it's cuz I'm mad, I feel like complete crap and try to fix it all day. 

I also have issues being honest with what I don't like. Like if something passed my internal boundaries, if I think saying something will upset someone I care about, I don't say anything. 
There's a lot of other stuff going on as well but these.are not mentioned.

So, is there anyone going through anything similar or can relate? Any thoughts, advise?

I need help,"Hey guys, so this may seem like a weird thing to need help with but I’m just trying to figure out if I’m actually depressed or if I’m going through something else.I’m nineteen and recently I just moved to another state for school and lately I haven’t been attending most of my classes and my grades are extremely bad right now. I just can’t seem to get myself to go. I’m just surprised because I have never done this before, it’s not like me to skip classes. Most mornings I just lay in bed until noon. I don’t know if this is extreme laziness or something else. I’m constantly in my head and I’m extremely worried about my grades but am I really that worried if I keep skipping class? I also feel like I have a lot of anxiety when I have to be around a lot of people, especially ones I don’t know. I know I’m an introverted person but being an introvert doesn’t mean that I have anxiety around a lot of people, I just prefer to be in a small group or by myself most of the time. I even get anxious when I’m just walking to class or going to the grocery store my myself. I don’t really feel happy most of the time, and I don’t think I’ve felt happy for a while. I can get temporary happiness by watching something funny or by reading a book since that’s my favorite thing to do, but right after I’m done I’m right back to where I was. I don’t understand what it is, I have loving parents and they have given me all I could hope for (they are helping me financially by helping pay for my rent and by paying for the classes I am taking right now) and yet I don’t have the decency to even repay that by going to class.

"Questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, about 72 hours before I start","In 48 to 72 hours, I will begin taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day, which will be my first time taking a pharmaceutical medicine for anxiety and depression, after my twelve-step program sponsor encouraged me to do so, and after my mother -- a psychiatric nurse encouraged me to do so.  


I have a robust support system, and for over seven years, I have regularly engaged in a myriad of modalities to address anxiety, depression, and hopelessness, and a pattern of burnout, including but not limited to cognitive behavioral therapy, two twelve-step programs, different forms of meditation, various mindfulness practices, hatha yoga, bhakti yoga, weightlifting, high-intensity interval training, long-distance running, reading books on personal development and introspection, different forms of journaling, a myriad of support groups, numerous supplements, psychedelics, etc. As one of my hatha yoga instructors has stated, I ""do all the things.""   


I have chosen to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg for many reasons.  


It seems to have minimal side effects in most people; based on my research and conversations with my psychiatrist and other doctors, it does not lead to some of the side effects that I am most concerned about, like weight gain, and it seems to be a manageable introduction to psychiatric medicine.   


Moreover, all of the previously-mentioned modalities have changed my life for the better since 2014. Still, a destructive and potentially life-threatening pattern comes up in my life, time and time again, and my psychiatrist, my mother, and others believe that Wellbutrin XL 150 mg may help.  


The pattern is as follows: I feel resentful about people that have intentionally or unintentionally harmed me in the past, I feel anxiety and shame about my finances, inconsistent income (that pays well when I do get paid) and the cost of living in downtown Toronto, I feel anxiety, guilt, and shame about my partial dependency on my parents and a myriad of other things, I feel anxiety concerning many nuances of operating two businesses while starting a third, I feel anxiety, shame, and guilt concerning my lack of a dating life (and sexual anorexia/the unconscious avoidance of dating), so I double-down on activities related to my businesses, I double-down on the seemingly beneficial and health activities that I previously mentioned, I work incredibly hard, going past my physical and psychological limits, I soothe myself by doing high-volumes of seemingly good things, I burnout, and then I become depressed, I experience suicidal ideation, and then I engage in self-soothing by raging, ruminating about my resentments, having sex with so-called ""high end"" escorts aka prostitutes, and binge eating processed food. 

This pattern happens about once or twice per month; it takes at least a couple of days to recover from, it is pretty destructive, and nothing that I have done since 2014 has put a permanent stop to it. I meditate every day, and I engage in the activities mentioned above every day, yet I often find myself in the same place.   


With that said, I have a few specific questions about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, and I am hopeful that someone through Reddit will answer them for me, as the pharmacist that dispensed the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg could not answer some of my questions.  


1. Meditating in sensory deprivation chambers/float chambers for an hour or longer, after taking 0.4 g to 1.2 g of psilocybin (psychedelic mushrooms), has been hugely beneficial to me for seven years, sometimes doing so is the only thing that gets me out of burnout. Still, there is little to no research on how psilocybin interacts with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, so what are some of the potential risks of taking psilocybin within the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day and after the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day?  


2. I am a daily cannabis user, usually vaporizing high CBD cannabis through a Pax 3 vaporizer. I have no problem stopping my cannabis use while I experiment with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. Still, there is little to no research on how cannabis interacts with Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, so what are some of the potential risks of taking cannabis within the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day and after the first two weeks of taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day?  


3. I learned that some people could experience mania or suicidal ideation while taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. In some cases, the individual experiences mania or suicidal ideation may not determine that they are in danger, so how can I tell if I begin experiencing such side-effects and what can I do to keep myself safe if I start experiencing such side-effects?  

4. I was hired for a professional speaking engagement that is taking place in mid-November -- slightly less than a month from now, so should I be worried about taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg leading up to it?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

The Effects of Depression on a Relationship [ADVICE],"I am in relationship with someone who has major depression. When it gets really bad for him, it gets bad for us. He can be a little mean, irritable. These times feel the loneliest for me. I can't help but feel sad as a consequence at times. I understand that in these moments he isn't himself nonetheless it still hurts. I am generally busy and there is distance between us. I feel guilty at times I can't do more and feel like I am being pulled everywhere in my life in general. I feel numb and sadness which I try like hell to ignore in myself to preclude any ideas of seeing a break-up as a resolution to how I am feeling. I do love him, his pain is my pain. There is a certain emotional fortification developed when you are in these types of relationships  perhaps that is why I feel like I am not allowed to crumble, need or want especially when it gets really bad.

Is there any better way to deal with this? with us? my loneliness?

ECT treatment,"So I'm 19 and I was just diagnosed with treatment resistant depression... My doctor recommended I consider ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). It sound suuper scary and I read about som pretty shitty side effects like memory loss short-term and sometimes long-term, apathy, difficulty concentrating and difficulty learning new information...

Does anyone have experience with this or know anything about this treatment? Should I even consider it?

I am finally able to admit I have depression.,I am not sure where to start here. I think i have been depressed for a long long time but I have always felt embarrassed to speak about it I have never mentioned it to friends family or my boyfriend but today I finally realised this feeling has not gone away for what feels like years. I was beginning to think this was just my personality now but I know deep down I wasn't always this way I was happy before but I don't really know what went wrong. I just really need to speak to someone who understands but I feel as though if I ever mention it out loud then people will just think I'm looking for attention or that I am over reacting. Even if I wanted to tell anyone the words just won't come out. I really need to fix this but I have no idea how. I can't keep going like this. I don't want to die but I don't want to be here either... I know there are people out there who are so much worse with depression than I but I can't handle this anymore I just want to be happy again. Everyday I get angry with people who don't deserve it and I don't even know what ever made me angry. I push people away who just wanted to be my friend. I always have a problem with everything and I am sick of it. Its not fair on others around me to have to walk on eggshells around me. I need to get a grip and fix this and stop being selfish because I am too embarrassed to admit that my mental health has been getting worse over the last few years.. I have spent the last few days researching and doing online tests and I think its time to admit it. Sorry for this long post I just needed it off my chest but like I said I am too much of a coward to speak out loud. Is there anyone who has got over depression? I understand we are all different but just looking for some advice before its too late.,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Help?,Im not sure how to start or talk about this i hate asking for help or putting my problems on others but im realizing i probably need to talk to someone. Ig ill just say im not sure what to do with myself. Ive repressed emotions my whole life to the point that up until last weekend i dont think id cried since i was a kid even going through relationships and losing people emotionally or physically just nothing. My mom has mental issues she never told me about until just recently when i tried talking to her about whats been going on with me as shes an incredibly private person but i had my first anxiety attack this past weekend and cried more than i can remember ever crying. Ive lost interest inthe hobbies that made me who i am. Ive slowly lost all my friends after getting out of highschool 2 years ago and i used to have a big group. But i have no one to talk to or be able to open up to now that im trying to. Most of them i fell away from slowly or had a falling out with but my best friend since 3rd grade killed his sister after having a psychosis episode he was my go to always there for me and i grew up alongside his sister tho whole time. I work with his dad and do talk to him about this stuff but theres only so much i can talk about with him as he lost both his son and daughter in the same night and doesnt know how to handle things himself. The other person i was incredibly close with completed our trio died of an overdose a few hours after id left his house. Ive never had a girlfriend who i really opened up to or caught feelings for but now that i did i just fucked things up by overthinking things and id never quite cared for a girl like i do her.

How to help boyfriend with depression who won’t open up to me,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. We both have had our struggles with depression. Recently I see he has been feeling down once again. He doesn’t want to go to a therapist because “ he knows what’s wrong, he just doesn’t have the motivation to do anything about it.” in his exact words:
“I don’t want to go to therapy because I see therapy as guidance method for improvement. I don’t feel like I need guidance, my problem is one of will and circumstance, I don’t doubt that I could benefit from it, but right now I see it as going out of my way to do something I don’t prioritize” 
Even though we’ve been together a while, he still does not feel comfortable opening up to me about how he is feeling. I’ve asked him ways that I can help him feel better, or support him and he says that talking about it won’t make him feel better. Is there anything I can do to help him? I hate seeing him be down like this and be unable to help him. I’ve also tried giving him space and left him alone for a bit. Am I being selfish for trying to help him? Are there other things I should try to help him feel better?

What can I do to help my family member,"My brother needs help. I’m not sure where to start. He has been drinking pretty heavily for years. Recently he did get help and was put on meds but when the prescription ran out he didn’t get another for weeks, has new meds now but hates taking them due to being drowsy and finding hard to function at work. 

I’ve recently moved in with him. I cook and clean for him, chat to him when he wants to chat. He says he doesn’t need help or he can’t be helped, that he’s independent but does thank me any time I do stuff for him. I want to show him he’s loved and tell him this. He thinks I’m being emotional and not to worry about him.

I’ve suggested trying different meds, going with him to talk to someone, taking time off work to trial different meds, he agrees he needs time off though feels bad to his team at work &amp; his boss.

What happens when you get well? How often do you pop by the doc?,"Hi guys,

I first went to a psychiatrist last summer. I had been self-medicating ""something"" with tons of caffeine for years and wanted and needed to get to the bottom of why I needed large volumes of coffee in order to function (the tipping point was having gallbladder surgery and caffeine being less of an option). Without it, there was an underlying tiredness and pessimism that wasn't shifting by itself, despite my best efforts at self care and healthy living.

The past fourteen months has been the drug merry-go-round I'm guessing many here are familiar with. First tried every ADHD stimulant which all improved functionality (like caffeine!) but *all* (literally every single one) also made me more depressed. Then an SSRI which made me tired but more optimistic. Finally, we've moved onto Wellbutrin.

I'm wont to say ""wow, I'm better!"" but I have a strong and positive feeling that *this* is going to be the chemical that shifts my dysthymia. Perhaps it will fizzle out. Perhaps I'll need something else. But .. after four weeks I'm feeling optimistic and well in a way that I haven't on anything I've tried so far (ie, I'm more than just wired, I'm confident and hopeful).

My question now turns to: okay, so what's next? Assuming that this is the drug for me, how often do you typically go to your prescriber just to make sure that things are working out okay? Is there such a thing as a yearly mental health checkup to verify that you're staying on course?

Basically, once you finally manage to shift depression or at least get it to a manageable point ... what does the ""maintenance"" process look like?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm   not supposed to feel that way so I try to ignore it, but the emotion   becomes so overwhelming that I can no longer ignore it. I'm supposed to be happy for them. I should stop wallowing in pity. An unspoken pitfall of depression is that you can become quite self-absorbed.

I'd love to be in a relationship, but not many people want to date the  mentally ill guy--which I guess is reasonable. Another shitty thing is  that my religion teaches you're not even allowed to *think* about sex before marriage, which makes my life so much harder now that I associate every urge I have with guilt.

What am I to do? Just continue suffering without any hope of a better life? Why?

I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging.,"Im (28m) shes (49f)There's a lot of backstory here so ill try to sum up some main points for context. My mother has substance abuse issues all through my life. It caused me to live with my grandparents multiple timea in my life from 3-6 then again from 11-16 til my grandmother died and i had nowhere else to go. I ended up living with her due to some medical issues for myself at the time i had to drop out of school.and get my GED and a job. She made me pay rent 250 a month full time 40 hours a week back then i was making roughly 280 dollars a week. Whatever pay rent no problem even though Id be more supportive of my kid going through a terrible time but whatever. I also had to pay for my own food and such.The problem was a lot. My room was storage for her and her boyfriend i literally had just a bed and the rest were boxes of junk the boyfriend who was a hoarder didnt want to throw out. On top of that he was a terrible person who would constantly bad mouth my mother, steal my weed and other things from my room(i actually caught him on camera and showed him and he still denied it to my face.) One day he did it in front of me and i beat the shit outta him and i ended up leaving and sleeping on friends couches etc. Now at the time I would've fucking killed for my mother. So her picking him over me kinda broke my heart back then but it is what it is. Fast forward a couple years(20) i ended up living back with her doing the same stuff but this time at least i had a room that didnt have junk in it. But the abusive boyfriend was still there and it was the same pay rent and.  all of my food. She starts letting her friends from the methadone clinic she goes too stay in the house...for FREE🤦‍♂️. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, that's not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor. 4 years later she makes a big deal about money and all this stuff and i go to find out that, first she never used my money to pay rent, it turned out from me talking to our landlord that she owed almost 6 months of backrent! I also found out that the boyfriend didn't contribute to any of the finances so at a young age she put her financial responsibility in my hands. We ended up getting evicted and I was pissed and didnt talk to her for 2 years then she got cancer. So i did what i felt was the right thing and was there for her regardless. She got better and now well this whole thing came from a argument the other day we had. I have major depression and i was trying to ask for help and she got mad at me cause i told her i can't talk to her about it. She asked why and i told her the truth that i dont wanna have a who had a sadder life competition. Because she has a habit of if i was to complain about my childhood instead of listening or sympathizing she would bring up things like oh i was molested my childhood wasn't that great. Yeah that's fucking terrible and all that but that doesn't excuse your decision for you children. You're supposed to work to make things better for them. Which is the only valuable life lesson she taught me, because she never did it. Now im in a ok place I'm in school full time work 2 jobs all so i can have a easier life, and she don't understand that I'm busy even though i told her this. Honestly she's the reason for a lot of my depression. it sucks having to coddle a parent, i have no guidance i feel lost half the time and she will never understand that.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Because of this I've started losing interest in every I used to enjoy. I used to love going to training but I'm beginning to think what's the point. As well my mind is starting to become self destructive. So many times these last 2 weeks, I haven't been able to look at myself in a mirror without saying something I hate about myself. It's brought me so close to the edge of hurting myself and I'm beginning to lose it.

I just want to have some I can trust and care about. But I'm getting so paranoid that everyone I like and know just hates me. It's gotten to the stage where im talking to people I like, and I'm over analyzing everything they say, thinking theyre just saying it out of pity for me. I just want someone, anyone to care about me. But I know no one ever will. I'm starting to think that there's no point in existing since no one would miss me if I'm gone.

I’ve had a rlly good last few days even today is fine so why do I feel so depressed?,"Sure there are definitely some things I’d change if I could.

Feeling Super Stuck - Would Love Some Advice,"Hey guys. I’m posting this in the depression forum because I’m hoping for some advice from people who know what it’s like to live with depression. I'm stuck in a bad situation with no good options, and I think it would be difficult for anyone without including severe depression and anxiety, but I've got that too. Also, I just think I need some compassion and understanding right now, and so this feels like the right place to post this.

TLDR: 

I’m a Canadian living in Houston. My wife is finishing up her surgical fellowship, and because of Covid, getting my US work authorization is taking forever. The combination of unemployment and being in a toxic relationship has left me miserable and fighting with depression and anxiety. If we didn’t have a two and half year old daughter I would have split with my wife a while ago. Without employment I can’t afford to get my own place here, and staying in this relationship is killing my soul. I’m feeling insanely stuck – any advice?

Long version: 

I’m living in Houston with my wife and two and half year-old daughter. My wife is a surgical fellow, and is currently deciding on which of the three job offers she has to become a full staff doctor in one of three US cities. I sold my business back in Canada earlier this year, and because of Covid (and probably the existing general slowness of the US government), getting my US work authorization is taking forever. I’m likely going to have to wait another three or four months until I’m able to work, and at that point I’ll still have to find a job. Unfortunately, as soon as my wife’s current job is over in June, I’ll have to stop working immediately, and will have to reapply for US work authorization again when she gets her new visa issued. So optimistically I’ll be able to work for four out of the next 12 months …and while I’m a highly qualified person, I may not be able to find a well-paying job right away. Working remotely for a Canadian company is possible, but those jobs pay poorly and they're surprisingly hard to come by. 

I grew up in an abusive home, and was abused basically daily from about the age of four until I left at 16. Turns out that the only other abusive relationship I’ve ever been in is with the person I’m currently married to. There was never physical abuse in my marriage, and my childhood trauma definitely factors in here. I could go on for pages describing the history and the current dynamics, but I’ll keep to the point by saying that I’ve made huge strides in understanding my mental health, that I know myself quite well, and that the chances of me being happy and fulfilled in the marriage are zero. There’s been a mountain of therapy, tonnes of conversations, over several years. I’ve been the “this is fine” meme for about four years now and I just can’t do it any more.  

If it wasn’t for our daughter, I would have broken up long ago. I’ve stayed because of her, and I’ve done my best to make the relationship work. It’s clearly not working though, and I’m feeling painfully stuck and I’m miserable. I have every reason in the universe to leave except for one reason, and she’s an amazing little human that I can’t imagine abandoning. 

So yeah, I have no frigging idea what to do. Staying in this relationship is a terrible option. I can’t afford to live in Houston without a job. Working remotely for a company in Canada is an option, but most pay terribly and I haven't had any luck landing one yet. Homelessness is technically an option, but not really. I could go back to my old job in Canada any time, but that’s a 23 hour drive away not counting traffic and bathroom breaks. 

I don’t have anyone in my life I can talk to about this, so I’m hoping for a little bit of emotional support here. 😊 This situation has me feeling unresolvable stuck, and for the first time in my life at times I’m feeling desperate and miserable. I know the right thing is to find a way through it with my wife for the sake of my daughter, but honestly I don’t think my soul can take it.

We were engaged. He left me for a 19 year old he has been talking to online for the past 3 months,"This will be quite a long story, and I also apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes, I’m Brazilian and English is not my first language.

We were always messaging, video calling and sending each other cards for special dates, so we could have something palpable.

Important to mention that his parents didn’t trust me enough to let him come here first, because there’s this stereotype of people from “third world countries” wanting to marry people from rich countries just to get citizenship, so in order to prove I wasn’t that type of person I had to go there first. I spent a long time trying to convince my parents to do so and also raising money for the ticket. Our mothers actually started messaging each other throughout the process, and that helped build some trust. Finally the day came, I got enough money for the ticket and bought it. That was one of the happiest days of my life. That was June 2019. We met on January 2020. The rest of 2019 I was just dreaming about the special day and I was so motivated I got the best grades ever at university. My life was perfect, I had nothing to complain about. 

So the day came. After almost 24 hours of flying and airport layovers, I was there. It was a feeling I’ll never forget: a mix of the good type of anxiety and victory for finally being able to meet the guy I loved. I stayed there with him from January to March 2020. He was extremely nice and romantic, I never felt so happy, he really was my soulmate. He was also a very emotional guy, wasn’t ashamed of crying and showing his emotions towards me. He asked me to be his girlfriend the day after I got there and he cried when I said yes. I never expected what I’ll tell next to happen though. On my last day there, his parents drove with us to drop me off at the airport, and he cried the whole way there. We spent some time by ourselves at the airport, and when the time came for me to go through security to go to the gates, he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I never expected that and I was just filled with happiness. Then I said yes but had to walk away, so yeah, even though it was a beautiful moment it was also very sad. 

I came back to Brazil and we just went back to our online relationship. He eventually came here on December 2020 and stayed until February 2021. We had an awesome time here, I took him to the beach, it was his first time seeing the ocean. I’ll never forget his smile when we went in the water. So towards the end of his stay we sat down with my family and told them our plans. His parents would give us, as their wedding gift, one of the best immigration lawyers in the United States, so I could get a K1 Visa and get married there. We started the process, sent them a bunch of documents and were just waiting on the government to give us a feedback. This process is a bit slow now because of the pandemic, so we spent this whole year waiting.

Now there comes the bad part of the story, that I never thought would happen. October 2021, the worst month of my life.
Actually, I need to go back a little bit, to August 2021. There was this Brazilian girl that did a high school exchange at his city a few years back, 2017/2018. They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked. When the Tokyo Olympics finally started, she posted a story on Snapchat about Brazil losing in a game of volleyball or something, that’s what he told me at least. Since him and I always watched the games together when we could, he knew about it and replied to her story making a joke. They’ve been talking ever since. He told her about me and our story, that we were engaged, etc, and she thought it was awesome and asked to follow me on Instagram. I accepted it. She was extremely nice to me in the beginning and also replied extremely fast. After a few days talking on there she asked me for my WhatsApp number. I’ll confess that I didn’t really want to give her because I barely knew her and I don’t like giving my number to random people. But I didn’t want to be rude so I ended up giving her my number and we started talking there. After just a little while talking on WhatsApp, she asked me if we wanted to do a video call with her (us 3). I thought she was moving way too fast with intimacy with us, but I asked my fiancé if he wanted to and he said it was up to me. I ended up accepting it. It was actually nice and we called once or twice more. Well, so this situation of her being friends with us lasted for about a month, but around the beginning of October I started being suspicious about some things with the two. We used to call every night before I slept (I’m at GMT-3 and he’s at GMT-5), and he started giving excuses to go to sleep earlier because he was feeling sick, tired, etc, and I believed him. Well, all those times he was ending our call earlier to call her for 3 hours straight. They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about. He also put ghost mode on on Snapchat so I couldn’t see when he was there talking to her, and he was always saying it was a glitch (I only believed that because Snapchat really is a very glitchy app, but none of the times I asked it was an actual glitch). He admitted everything after. They were flirting, sexting and everything and at the time it was just two months after they started talking.

I only found out because a few days after I started getting suspicious, I messaged him asking if she had ever flirted with him. He said yes, and I freaked out. I also found out later on that the moment I sent him that message they were on a call, and he told her so she was pressuring him to tell me the truth. That’s the only reason why he said yes. Then as I saw he wasn’t replying to my messages, I called him and obviously interrupted their call. He answered. This was a long call, I told him everything I had been suspicious about and he confirmed every single thing. Then, at night, we called again. Our longest video call ever. 9 hours and 37 minutes straight. I’ve been so bad lately that I can’t remember everything, but how it went was basically me telling him all my feelings, how I would do everything over and over again to have the same love and happiness feeling as I did when I went there, how I would sacrifice everything how many times I would need to, just to feel that way again. Then also about our dreams of having a family and everything, how he destroyed everything within a few days. I’ve seen him cry lots in the past, but nothing like this night. He was bawling his eyes out. The call lasted all night. It ended at around 7:30am and I slept until 8:30am.  He slept longer than I did. When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness. Yes I know, I’m stupid, but I was going to forgive him. He was telling me that anything I wanted him to do to gain my trust back, to let him know. I told him to block her in all social medias. He did. He sent me screenshots of everything. 

The long call happened from a Friday night through a Saturday morning. His regret and attempt to try gaining my trust back only lasted until Sunday. These two days he spent apologizing and telling me how he wanted to grow old with me, that kind of stuff. Well, like all this didn’t seem bad enough, the worst part of the story comes now. On Monday morning, I was at the gym, and I got a message from him. The way he wrote seemed odd, so I asked if something was wrong and he said he didn’t feel good. I immediately left the gym and told him to give me a few minutes, that I would get home and we could call. As soon as I got home, I didn’t even shower or anything, I just went to my room and called him. Then he just finished shattering my heart. He said he needed to be honest with me. He said that from the very first time we met in person, when I went there, he felt something wasn’t right between us. That he didn’t feel a connection. He said kissing and other intimate moments felt weird. He said he only proceeded with everything, asked me to marry him, started my Visa process and everything because he was scared of being alone. Since he never had another relationship before and I was the first one that ever got interested in him, he felt like he had to do everything he could to keep me in his life, so he wouldn’t end up alone. Now that he had found this other girl, he felt he really connected with someone. I was stabbed in the back multiple times by the person that always said that I was his soulmate and by a girl that came into my life pretending to be my friend, and I actually believed that. This same day he unblocked her in all social medias and changed his profile picture everywhere (it was a picture of us).

So yeah, my world just fell apart in a matter of days. He became what he criticized the most and I became what I feared the most. I’m already a skinny person and I lost around 4kg in a week. I never had trouble sleeping, now I simply can’t have at least a decent night of sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night many  times with my heart racing, I have multiple nightmares about the situation. I even had a few panic attacks. I don’t have energy to do anything. I’m on my last semester of college and I can’t do anything. I can’t eat, I’ve thrown up multiple times and just seeing food makes me nauseous. I honestly rather be dead than have all these feelings. Less than a month ago I was the happiest person ever, I had something to look forward to, I had someone in my life that I thought that loved me. Turned out it was just a huge lie. 

No matter how much I write about this, how much detail I put into everything, I won’t be able to describe my sadness and emptiness. I would wish no one this feeling, not even them.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just a dumb person who doesn't have anyone,"A few weeks back I found a little break for a few weeks. Thought it would make me feel a little better but it didn't turn out that way ig. I have time off but no one wants to hang out or spend time with me. I just sit in my room lying and bad memories keep running on and on. I can hardly breathe many times. Just lay there paralyzed no idea what's happening in my head or surroundings.
Many things working against me lately in life but there's no one to just help me with those. I don't know how or what to do. I just wanna die for once.
I have seen so many rejections now need someone to accept coz it's taking a toll on me. I can't sleep even tho I am so tired. The only thing that goes on in my mind mostly is how badly I wanna die. Just everything I thought about how I'd like my life to be has completely fallen apart and there is no hope to fix anything.

Low functioning depression,"Hi reddit.

The title of this post is quite ironical as I've spent the last 10 minutes making a new account just so I could post this 'anonymously', have had to get out of bed for it and have finally dedicated myself to doing at least *something* today. Nonetheless, I see this situation as a minor bright spot in my current life and desperately need advice regardless.

I am a senior high-schooler from a low-income family in Europe. Ever since I was 13 or 14 years old I've been struggling with some kind of self-diagnosed (I never went to therapy for many reasons) depression and/or anxiety. The causes of such problems have changed throughout the years, but they were mostly linked with social anxiety, unhealthy amount of self-imposed academic stress and god knows what else. My first two years of high school were marked by drenching amounts of anxiety regarding new acquaintances, extremely low self esteem, low functioning due to stress and frequent suicidal thoughts and wishes. Over time, my social anxiety went away, with it most of my problems, and for the last year I haven't felt as close as bad as I did before. I thought my depression finally disappeared, and that I've changed as a person. Now, I know I was wrong.

At the moment I am experiencing a great deal of stress caused by university planning. Like previously mentioned, I live in a low-developed European country in a low-middle class family. My biggest chance to do something with my life is to go to university abroad, as universities in my country are pretty much shit. I've dedicated all of my elementary and high school education to university planning, constantly striving for good grades, many extracurriculars and additional tests. And now, when the time has finally come to apply for universities and write my damn personal essays and send them, I blocked. I cannot make myself to sit and write the essays, as I am a huge perfectionist and am (probably) scared to start writing as I fear they won't end up good. The more time passes, the more stressed I am, the harder it is to focus, and it all ends up being a great, vicious circle. It is the beginning of November, I need to send the university apps as soon as possible, and what am I doing? After spending my whole day laying in bed, sleeping and crying, I am writing on reddit for help as I am on a verge of a mental breakdown, once again, for two months and counting.

And yes, I am aware there are worse problems one can encounter in life. And yes, I am very much aware that issues like these can be easily solved by investing a bit of willpower, but I do not have any more strength to do so. I need advice. Any advice. A change of perspective. Anything. Please, anything. I do not have much time, I am feeling worse as seconds pass, my anxiety has spread out on many different aspects of my life. Consequently I don't do anything, I don't sleep well, I don't exercise, I don't eat well. I've become a nihilistic, lazy person who is anxious about almost everything. Again. Every part of my body hurts every day, as this is how I usually react to procrastination and low productivity.

I know I need just the smallest amount of strength to begin my work and stop all this, but I cannot find it on my own. Please help me, because I know if I mess this up I will never fully recover. I am so stressed and so scared. Please give me any advice you have, anything that you think may help. Some plan, something new, anything. Please. I cannot do this anymore and I cannot live like this anymore.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1

Shadow.,"I've suffered from depression &amp; anxiety all my life, in spells. It's always there but I can usually manage it.

This last few weeks has been rough, I'll spare the detail as there's some personal stuff.

My concern is that wherever I go, I feel like there's this shadow following me.

Like, 6'7"" black shadow in my peripheral vision, always there. Whether I'm in bed, the kitchen, the car, or out for a walk, just feel this presence behind me, an inch away from my back just towering over me.

Always just out of sight, but I know it's there.

Being a teenager sucks,"Hi,
To preface this I'm going to sum up myself. I'm a lonely geek teenager that's an only child with no pets, like stereotype computer geek. 
I just got back into physical classes again after 2 years doing online ones which I preferred I just moved and am having a tough time making friends and a tough time with my parents We're in a small apartment while ours gets renovated so I'm sleeping on the couch and then going to school with no privacy really. My parents always try to turn the tables on me and then make things my fault or make me do things then insult me for things I'm forced to do. I got some clothes a while ago I said I didn't like and I said I didn't like the fit , so I didn't wear them, now its my fault that I ""asked for them"" (or other times they just say that I have to wear stuff because they say so). It feels like every night there's a screaming match between me and my dad or my parents , my mother is always seemingly depressed or has an attitude , I don't have friends and don't know how to make any. I just really don't know what to do. Teenagers nowadays don't care about Linux or old music , all they wanna listen to is shitty rap and use fucking tiktok. 
When we went to my doctor I had to take an exam where I have ""high signs of depression"" and my parents were told I should see a psychologist , that never happened of course They have alcohol with breakfast, lunch, and dinner which doesn't help either and it always feels like the standards are against me and that everything I do gets judged. They treat me like they own me and like I can't speak. Because no matter what I think my mom is always more important (all she does it cook and smash I swear to god) I really don't know what to do.  I've tried offing myself in the past and my mom laughed at me and screamed ""don't be ridiculous"". I tried to come out as LGBT+ to them and was made fun of and still am and I have to lie that I'm not. It makes me so angry seeing other people in classes and knowing they have pets and siblings and loving parents , and I don't. 
""We just want the best for you""
Telling me to off myself and that everything I do isn't goof enough doesn't fucking solve that. 

As I said , idk what to do","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
accountability buddies,"i need an accountability buddy on discord. 
i have been depressed fr as long as i can remember but later i cant do anything, i had periods like this in the past but now i am starting to get used to it and i hate it. 

we can make a server on discord, just for us two, a vent channel so we can dumb our thoughts somewhere, a to do list for each day, and encourage each other. I'm sorry i am not sure how this works exactly but if you have any other suggestions you can add them.

i would need someone extremely open minded though because i have been through a lot of unexpected stuff. 
of course i will try to help too.

please reach out if you are interested in us helping each other. just keep in mind that i am looking for a friend not a partner so your sexuality should not matter (thought i know straight men or lesbians feel more comfortable talking to girls in general and that is okay).

i don't care about your race or gender or anything but i am kind of beat down of talking to so many strangers on reddit without actually building a meaningful connection with anyone so please leave sort of intro in the comments.

How do I fight again numbness and guilt?,"I'm 21f and I have had a terrible year so far, in which my depression has reached levels I've never imagined. 

I have had this feeling for a few weeks now. I wake up every day knowing it will be the same. I feel like a bag of meat, just hovering around the house doing things on autopilot. I don't eat much, cause my family is going through a very though situation so there's not much to eat. 

I'm in college and I get stuff to do all the time. I've been a very good student so far, but lately, I've barely had the energy to check on my assignments... I feel terrible for not putting much effort anymore, because this might be probably the only way I can help my family in the future. I can't sit on my desk and get things done bc my arms feel heavy and my head empty.

I thought that maybe getting a new job would help me getting my life together and distract me from everything that happens at home, so I applied for part time tele marketing jobs, but don't receive any call backs. My teaching job is very unstable so I decided to step back because it was taking more than it was giving me... 

 I feel the constant need to cry and just curl up in my chair and stay there forever. I hate feeling this empty and lonely... How can I get out of this downward spiral? 

I'm really really sorry if this sounds like I'm just venting.

I Need Help,"( sorry for my bad English ) 
This year my life turned upside down when my parents broke up. In my family everyone dislikes me without telling me . I am like their own personal helper. Also everyone in the house is against me , for example when me and my brother fight everyone will help my brother , when i and my mom fight everyone supports my mom because she is always superior from me and the best thing is that sometimes when my older brother fights with my mom they bring me into the topic and start saying things like "" he always studies and he will never achieve his dreams "" or something like that. And the best part is that i cannot get help , i don't want to speak to my mother and solve the problem , i keep everything inside me. One time i was brought to a hospital to speak to a psychiatrist ( the guy that helps you when you have a phonological problem ) and i started crying because i learned that when thing get tough start crying.

I don't know what to do and i am so shy and antisocial that i cannot even ask a teacher for help.

I wasn't diagnosed with depression,"So I spoke to a psychiatrist today. I've been suspecting that I'm depressed for years now. I have a hard time with really basic tasks/personal hygiene. I have no energy. I have really demeaning thoughts about myself, and my self esteem is extremely low. I think about dying pretty much all the time, and my suicidal ideation has greatly increased recently. I have no motivation and I can't see any kind of future for myself, let alone a happy one. Just generally, I'm not happy at all. 

Now, the psychiatrist told me I have generalized anxiety disorder, and I was diagnosed with anxiety years ago, so that makes sense to me. But when I told him everything that I mentioned above and then some, he told me that these symptoms were not the primary focus, and that treating anxiety should make them go away.

He never explicitly said that I have depression, which is throwing me off. Obviously I'm not a professional, but the way he didn't actually name the reason for my symptoms is making me feel like such an idiot. I feel like all this time, I've been making it up; that I'm not actually depressed and all my symptoms are just in my head. I just don't know what to do. I feel horrible about myself.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
I wrote my letters,"To start it am safe, I am not planning on ending my life for now. 

I wrote my letters today. I wanted to see what I would say to my loved ones. They were surprisingly easy to write. 5 total. My ex-wife, 2 friends and my parents. The ones to my parents were the hardest. I know they are what had kept me alive as long as I have been. I don't want them to have to bury me. That is not a burden I want them to have. But having these letters written does give me some relief in knowing that if I can't hold back the pain anymore that they will know that I did my best and that they were wonderful parents. And that it was not because of them I am gone. That it was because of them I lived as long as I did. That my pain became too much but not because if them. It was my internal demons. So they will know that I held out as long as I could. 

so I have to keep going for now. So they will never see that letter.

People who don't have school/work: what do you do?,"For the people out there who aren't in school and don't work, what do you do with your time? And I know it sounds like I'm being rude, but I really want to know. 

Long story short, I've been in college for a few years with worsening depression. It's likely that I'm going to take a leave of absence because it's become painfully clear to me that I can't handle school. I don't want to leave school, but I made exactly zero progress towards my degree this semester and it's a massive waste of money to stay in school at my current mental state. I'm in the middle of trying a new antidepressant (my sixth in about three years) and my current plan is to move home for the upcoming semester so that I have time to figure out treatment (because trying a new antidepressant takes like three months and if this medication isn't the one, then that's another quarter of the year down the drain). 

But I've been trying to figure out what I'll do with all my time and...I find myself drawing a blank. Sure, I'll be trying medications and going to therapy, but that'll take a couple hours per week at the absolute maximum. I can try to exercise, but again, that's maybe an hour out of my day if I can find the energy to do it. The rest of the time, I have absolutely no idea what to do other than watch Netflix and YouTube and go on Reddit, all things which I *know* are bad for my mental health and make me feel even more like I have no sense of purpose. I don't think I can handle getting a job (maybe on a part-time basis, but I'm not sure if I can deal with even that). My family has dogs, so I'll take care of them, but still, I anticipate having hours and hours of time in which I have to entertain myself alone. 

tl;dr I'm going to leave school temporarily, but I don't know what I'll do with all my time other than mindlessly browse the Internet. For those of you who don't go to school or work, what do you do with your day? What gives you a sense of structure and purpose?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm 18. All my life I've been alone. I've been bullied, beaten, mocked, and hated. I'm tired of living everyday and knowing I'm going to feel worse than yesterday. Everyday is just more pain. Idek what to write because theres so much to say. I'm alone...and depressed. I probably sound like everyone else...but at this point I'm desperate. Making friends is hard...
I'm sorry...all my thoughts are racing so it's hard to know what to write. Everyone is finding love...and here I am...alone...and depressed. My friends always say ""looks dont matter"" YES THEY DO!!!

....they do...


I'm alone...


Im not just depressed because of that...I am nothing. Nothing I do matters...I am nothing...I'm a nobody. I've attempted suicide 2 times and failed. An you know who cared? Fucking nobody......

....nobody...

Please someone hear me....I'm at the end of my rope...I'm tired...im wasting away slowly...losing hope...losing friends....and I'm done with that...please.....if you see someone who is alone...talk to them..help them...because I know how it feels to be...abandoned...
I want to spread awareness about depression...but I know...death is nearing for me.....and I cant talk to anyone...because when I do....they always say I can vent to them but they just end up annoyed with me and leaving me...everyone leaves me!! Everyone!! I just....I just need help...I'm losing grip on my life...
If anyone even reads this...I want you to take one thing away from my pain...Be kind to everyone...please..you don't know what some people have been though.....I will attempt suicide again...maybe today...idk...

Help with ex girlfriend (trying to stay friends) (M29) (F28),"So my ex girlfriend was going through a rough time with her depression and ended the relationship to say that it wasn't fair on me and that she needed to focus on herself. She still wanted to be friends and we've chatted off and on for a few weeks but recently she's gone radio silent, leaving my messages unread. Even after we broke up it had been a back and forth between who started conversations.

I don't know if this is her way of letting things fizzle out entirely or if this is her depression taking a turn for the worst. I can see that she's been online (thanks invasive apps tracking login/active times) so at least I know she's still alive but I'm worried about her.

Deep down I still love her and I care about her as a friend but I'm a little lost on what to do. I want to give her space but I suppose I also want a definitive answer as to whether things are over in terms of friendship and I feel guilty and selfish.

I don't want to smother her or take too much of a step back but my experience of depression is non-existent.

Idk why. I didn't know anyone else that was going to be there and that made me just freeze and not go. 

Now my sister hates me I'm sure. She posted on her story a picture that said ""being constantly let down by the one person you looked up to all your life is really exhausting."" Which hurt, but it's absolutely true. It hurts because I fucking make these choices and I hate them. I have the time. I have the ability. I just choose to fucking stay home instead and I HATE myself.

Things just keep getting worse,"Sorry this is so long. One thing after another just keeps happening to me..

Things have been really bad for several years. I lost a really great job and I haven't been able to find another. Everyone says I'm over qualified and won't stick around, or that I'm great but they went with another candidate. I'm facing eviction for the 3rd time in 3 years. I've applied for aid with my county and state, but even though I started in May I haven't gotten any help.

I've somehow managed to keep the electricity on until now. I previously owed the power company money and they spread the debt out over months. But this month I couldn't make my payment, so the payment arrangement was canceled and they said my electricity would be disconnected. I don't live in a state where they won't cut off your electricity in the winter, and there is no way I can come up with almost $800. I expect them to disconnect my service Monday morning. I'm freaking out and can't sleep because I'm afraid when I wake up the power will be off.

I interviewed twice for an absolutely amazing job, and about 2 1/2 weeks ago they offered me they job. I got so excited because I thought things would finally start getting better. They said the offer was dependent upon passing a background check. Originally I was supposed to start Nov. 8. Background check took almost 2 weeks, then they said it was done and were talking about shipping me a laptop (job is remote for out of state company). Then Friday they told me the background check had brought up some things that required additional information from me. 

I got a copy of the report and it shows 2 misdemeanor charges from 2019. I was pulled over and ticketed for not having insurance or current car tags (cause I didn't have $ for either). And I bounced a check that I wasn't able to cover. I was fined for both,  but I haven't had the money to make any payments on either. I was hoping this great job would let me take care of those. 

On the background check it says I was sentenced to jail - I wasn't, but might even been for failure to pay the fines. There may be warrants out for my arrest for failure to pay the fines, I don't know.

They still haven't told me what additional information they need, but I don't really think it could be anything but that. I feel like my mistakes and being poor the past few years are going to prevent me from ever getting a job and making things better. I've made mistakes, I've paid for them, I've learned from them. But I just haven't been able to pay the fines.

Even if they decide to give me the job, I have doubts they'll have me start next Monday since people will be off for Thanksgiving. So I wouldn't even start working til Dec. and wouldn't get a paycheck until Dec. 15.

And this job is remote and I can't work from home once the power is cut off. I don't have anybody I can ask for any type of help. And I'm really feeling pretty hopeless right now. It's literally taken me years to get this 1 job offer and it's looking like it isn't going to happen. I just don't see how things can get better when it looks like things are definitely going to get worse.

I could use the public WiFi somewhere like the library, but I don't know how I could do that while being on Zoom calls for most of the day. Even with a headset I'd still be bothering others when I'm talking. If you've got a better idea of what I could do for a few weeks, please let me know.

I would LOVE to have a good job, get caught up on rent and utility bills, pay my fines and get on with having a life. I'm just so frustrated and discouraged and depressed right now.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Depression is Ruining my Relationships,"I have been feeling depressed for a while now and it’s only getting worse every day. I can’t get out of bed, do any of my uni work or even clean the house and look after myself. I could deal with this but recently I’ve been pushing people out of my life (mainly my partner because I live with him) and I don’t know what to do. I have panic attacks when I think about losing him, but because I’m so depressed I’ve convinced myself it would be the best think for both of us.

I feel lonely even though there's no need to,"So I (25m) gotta say that mostly my life is great - I have a lot of friends (online &amp; offline) and a lot of people like me for who I am which is very important for me.   
However - I have always been someone who was very lacking female contact. My whole life whenever I had female friends it was something very special to me and mostly those friendships were more important to me than to them. Always wanted to have a ""best female friend"" but after years where this wish never came true I gave up on it. 

  
At the moment I mainly have contact to two of my female friends. One is my ex girlfriend and we message each other occasionally. I know that she's very busy so naturally it's rare for her to message me. But when we chat then it's always very fun for both of us and we have a great time. And then nothing for like 1 or 2 months. I sometimes tell her how I'm very happy when she messages me and stuff and then she always insists that it's so rare because she has no time. So I can kinda cope with it.   
Then there's another (online) friend who I have known for roughly two and a half years now. We once were really close and even planned to meet up once but then quarantine hit and then the plan kinda fell into the water. Somehow the contact got less and less until it started again about a year ago. Mainly when it's her or my birthday we keep saying how we should get into a voice call again and play some games like we used to. But then again when I ask her later she either says ""yeah we should do that soon"" or when she says ""I guess it could work out tonight"" she does not cancel it but at the same time I cannot reach her and the next day she says stuff like ""Sorry didn't work out"". I'm a very understanding person so I can easily accept that. However when you have planned something I think it should be your duty, if you post pone it, to message that person again and make a new plan. That doesn't happen. Last time she cancelled the plan nearly two weeks ago and I haven't heard from her since. 

I have social anxiety and even though that got a lot better during the last years it can still be an awful big challenge for me to message someone on my own (especially if I really care about that person). In these cases I can overcome myself after some time but it seems to be me doing the work way too often. Something you got to know is that I'm someone who likes to live for the good of others. I love to do stuff for my friends and make them happy. When my friends are happy, so am I. But obviously in a friendship there's always two parts.  
All I would want is an occasionally message from these people who are so important to me. Just a simple thing that makes me realize that at least in that very moment I was in their thoughts. Show me that you thought of me and I'm the happiest person. But leave me in the dark for weeks and I fall into  a big hole. 

Worst thing is that there are so many people who talk to me daily and who show that they care about me daily. And even though I'm surrounded by so many people close to me I still feel lonely simply because the desire in my heart for these other friends have a whole different weight. I feel bad to feel lonely because I have no need to. Because I know that there are many people who would love to have what I do. I'm a very emotional person and I can hardly cope with pain like this. Sometimes I ask them why we don't message each other more often. And days after that we do, but then it stops again. Then it feels like they only did it because I asked them to. So I practically did the work again and it thus it makes me feel worse than before. 

Obviously I know that we aren't as close as we once were. I know that they are probably busy with life (I'm unemployed so I'm trapped with my thoughts very often) and that they have other people closer to them who they (probably) rather spend time with. But I don't see how it is hard work to think about my friends at least once in some weeks. Maybe stuff like that is way more important to me than to others. I know that I love myself and who I am and that's why it's even harder for me to understand this. Am I doing something wrong? Are my expectations too high even though, in my opinion, they're pretty much as low as they could possibly get? Am I just knowing the wrong people?    
This is not something that gets me down on a regular base. It's more like a phase that lasts for a couple of hours and then I'm fine again. But lately this has occured more often and for longer periods of time. And obviously this affects my daily life as well because once I'm depressed I mostly just sit there and don't know what to do with my time. Everything suddenly seems boring. Even though one simple message (for example, it's not like this is the only thing that causes me to get depressed) would potentially fix it. 

Sorry for this essay. I'm not a native speaker so there could be some mistakes. But I do hope that at least someone takes the time to read through it and give me an honest opinion what I should do. How do you think I can convice them to think about me more often? It honestly seems like begging to me and I would rather avoid that. I just want the heartache to stop...","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
How am I supposed to improve my life when I constantly want to die,"
Even during my depression I’ll get these small mini bursts of optimism and motivation thinking, “maybe I can make it?! Maybe I can improve my life and be happy!” And I’ll go to the gym for one day, or run, or try to learn something new, but that’s short lasted. The second I complete the task all I can think is. “What’s the point? I’m probably going to die anyway, so why spend time improving myself?” 

I honestly have no will to even live life, all my energy is spent just existing by distracting myself and spending money on stupid shit just to forget about life.

I saw them for some graduation drinks after they convinced me to meet them. I really tried to be okay, telling myself it will all be fine, but it wasn't.

It's a weird complex where I love them and want to see them but when I do I'm really sad and want to be alone forever and when I'm alone I want to see them, and the cycle continues.

At what point is someone ill enough to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital?,"Early this year, I tried to kill myself, and I asked my psychologist if I could be admitted to the government psychiatric hospital (can't afford private) so she she some research into it and they said that I'm not ill enough.


This time, I have a detailed plan with a guaranteed method of killing myself, there's no way it could fail, and a set date. But I want to go to the World Cup in Qatar next year. The thing is, as much as I want to go for that, the life that I face in the wait until then us quite horrific. I'm going to be forced to go to university and I refuse to do that, but I know it's going to result in massive fights with my family where I'll be cornered and ridiculed as a failure, and I won't have support support friends either because they agree that university is best for me.


So I'm wondering if I could perhaps find a way into the psychiatric hospital until it's time to go to the World Cup so that I can avoid my awful life on the outside, or I'll be forced to kill myself and miss out on the World Cup.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Advice on How to Escape Living Situation,"I know this is a long shot, but thought it wouldn't hurt to put this out there and maybe get some helpful advice.

At the beginning of this year I was working hard to set myself up to be independent to escape living with my family. Living with my family messes with my mental to the point I can't function properly day-to-day. I really need to be on my own.

Things were getting better, but my life basically turned upside down. To sum it up I've been dealing with health issues the last year that have made it to where I'm in bed most of the day, and worse of all at home with my family more than ever.

I've been working with doctors to help find a solution to my health issues, but tests have been unhelpful, and my next appointment to see a specialist isn't until January 2022.

I can't begin to explain how close I am to ending it. I hope I can find some helpful advice, but there is literally no resource in the world where I can get the medical/mental help I need. I have no friends/family to go to, and there isn't much more I can take of this.

I literally physically can't do anything to escape this other than suicide. All advice so far is to hold on and let my mental get worse and worse, while my physical health doesn't get any better. 

Please someone say something different that will actually help.

Am I depressed? *trigger warning*,"I, 23 (Male) have been feeling weird FOR YEARS. I don't really know if I'm depressed or not because I have never been to therapy and probably never will because It's hella expensive from where I'm from.

I don't want to self-diagnose my 'depression' because I just find that weird and wrong. 

I was 12 when I first harmed myself, I don't think I did it a lot but back then, I just thought I was just influenced with the whole 'emo' phase a lot of people my age then was so into. I had a few attempts growing up, and that's when I started thinking maybe I really am depressed, because even If i didn't do 'it' constantly throughout the years since I first did it, there would be days where I thought dying would just be the best option because I felt so shitty all the time.

I googled the symptoms of depression as I grew older and would relate to most of it, BUT i still could not find myself to think that I am depressed since I have not even checked in with a professional.

Today, I have been feeling so bad about everything, I could explain In details about my life but It won't be necessary for this post. Some days there's a reason for me to be sad, and some days I just don't know what's the root of my sadness. I would just feel like shit even though I had a great day, and I could never really point out WHY i'm sad and it frustrates me until I cry and just try to exhaust myself and sleep and hope that I feel better when I wake up.

Someone, please help, I really don't know what I could do anymore.

I haven’t been myself since 2020. Will I ever go back to normal or should I just give up on life?,"
I was a straight A college student and part time EMT. Now I’m an unemployed college dropout living at my parents’ house. I gained 40 pounds and stopped enjoying my usual activities. 

I feel like I go from doctor to doctor and none of them give a shit about any of this. The depression started very suddenly in January of 2021 and it’s gotten progressively worse ever since then. Things completely spiraled out of control in October because that’s when I distanced myself from all of my friends. 

I’ve been on 20mg lexapro for several years and I just switched to trintellix a month ago. But… Trintellix makes me feel awful. If anything, I’m worse off than I was before. I have slight brain fog constantly. I have emotions again, which is good, but they’re all negative. I’m just sad and angry 24/7. 

I went to the doctor again today because they said I had “minor hypothyroidism” the last few times I got blood work done. Hopefully I’ll get medicated for that. I just feel powerless. 

I’m like a victim of my own mind. Before this very sudden bout of depression, I was so happy and excited about life. Now it’s as if I have no future because I can’t control my depression and no one is helping me to do so. 

I haven’t been myself since 2020. I don’t know what to do.

I started taking adderall in January and that’s when I started getting depressed.

How do i force myself to go to the gym when i don't have motivation/friends to go with?,I'm always told exercise is good for people struggling with depression. but i can never bring myself to go to a gym despite owning a membership to one through my family. but i hate the idea of going to a gym alone even if i know people will generally not bother me. i also have no friends that live in the same area that i do so i couldn't go with them. is there anything i can do or do i just have to eventually force myself to go alone and have no plan on what to do.,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've always been depressed but somethings different.,"Lately I've been having extreme difficulty leaving my room. Everytime I'm around anyone my heart starts racing and I feel like I'm having a panic attack. I also keep hearing people Whispering to me but I can't tell what they say and sometimes they manifest as full on people that I can see and carry on conversations with. Also I've been noticing that everything has a dark and sinister undertone. I hear people's conversations and things on TV and I can't help but think they relate to me and my living situation in a dark and sinister way somehow. And I've completely given up trying to talk to anyone about anything because no one can understand me. They say I talk too fast or say things that ""don't make sense"" or that they find ""incoherent"" and Lately i feel my life is just dragging on and on. Idk it just feels like I've become a ghost of myself and I'm being driven by something else. Like some baleful evil shadow from beyond time and space has grabbed onto my soul and slipped itself into my television consciousness and is now possessing me. Please help? Is it normal to feel this way?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"My girlfriend wants to commit s, I don't know what to do. Help"," Idk what to do. My girlfriend has been adamant lately that whe will commit suicide by the end of January. She has major chronic depression and on hee meds, but her parents were never supportive and doesn't believe in mental health, nor her conditions in general. Believing that she's just wasting her life. Her father wants to kick him out of house asap bec she came out as trans mtf, and couldn't really accept her sexuality, plus she dropped out school, and quit work this sem because everything was heavy for her and she doesn't have any energy to do something, even small things.
  
I'm just so scared that she's going to really do it. Idk what to do, I really want to tell this to her parents. But she told me don't ever tell them. And I'm so scared, idk what to do. I want to write a letter to her parents and tell them this important situation atleast, would that be possible?","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
When you're the rock but have no one to lean on.,"It's Thanksgiving and I spent the day with my mom taking our beloved doggo to the vets because she was sick. She's okay now but my mom was crying and I held myself together and was there for her. 

She thanked me for being there to help her remain calm and I am happy to be there for her. But inside the whole time I was freaking out and scared for the dog. 

I realized I don't have anyone to lean on. I have two guy friends but we have that whole ""don't talk about your emotions"" thing going on because we're not good at discussing feelings. 

I see my therapist but she isn't always around and sometimes I just want to be held and be allowed to cry. It's hard always having to be strong when I'm carrying the weight of depression with me everywhere I go.","[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'no'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
